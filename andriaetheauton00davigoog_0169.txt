ι’* Ex quo” in Livy xxvii. 503 xxxiv. 26 ; Ter. Hecyr. 111. iv. 7, Dies
triginta aut plu-s eo in navi fni.—-Neque—⁴nemo .· compare Andr. Ι. ii.
33, ‘⁶ Neque tu haud dices tibi non praedictum.” Neque in the present
case seems to follow with the second clause, as if “ nec quisquam ” had
preceded in the first.

13. Proinde quasi. &c., ‘⁸ Just as if you had none.’' Proinde = “ per-
inde ” here, and at Phorm. II. iii. 35, Proinde expiscere quasi non nosses.
Cic. pro Τ. A. Milone, 31, Proinde quasi nostram ipsam mentem, δια,
where, however, Orellius reads “perinde'’—Qfficia sunyere. For this
archaic use of the accusative with fwnqor, compare Adelph. III. iv. 18,
‘⁴ Functus officium.” So “ utor,'' and ‘⁴ abutor‚” Andr. Pr01. 5, Poenul.
Plano. V. ii. 128.

17. Aut aliquid fme. Bontley reads “ aliquid facere denique.''
because Donatus so quotes this verse in his note on Phorm. 1. ii. 71 ς
and because in one MS. it is so read. But see Cic. in Fin. i. 1. Denique
occurs, as here, in the beginning of a sentence, but end of a line, in
Andr. 1. i. 120 3 Eun. Prol. 40, διο. Zeune, however, preferred punctu·
ating aster ⁴⁴ deniqu0,·’ adduoing Eun. L ii. 78, and Phorm. 11. ii.11.
Consti-ue “ or carrying some burden.’' “ In fine,” or, “ in a word,” διο.
Ruhnken seems to consider aliquid serre to mean “ undet-going some
other toi1.” But the former sense is simpler.

19. “ Voluptati, here, as elsewhere in Terence, must,” observes Parry,
‘⁸ be scanned as an anapaest. in the second foot, followed by a long sylla-
ble ( ν ν· -). “Tibi'' before “esse'' entirely vanishes in scansion = t’esse.'’
-Δι enim, δια, “ But, you ’11 urge, Ι ’m not satisfied with the amount
of work here.'’ At, and at enim constantly introduce the words of an

objection, real or supposed. See Eun. 11. iii. 90; Phorm. III. ii. 2.- “

For poenitet, in the sense of being dissatisfied, see Phorm. 1. iii. 20.

21, 22. Quod in opere, δια, “ As to the amount of personal labour
which you consume in doing your work '’ (or, “ in bringing it to a pro-
fitable account '') “were you to spend it on keeping your slaves at
work, you would be more benefited.’' For this sense of “ exerceo,”
Ruhnken refers to Virg. Georg. i. 210, Exercete, viri, tauros. Adelph.
IV. ii. 48, Ego te exercebo hodie, ut dignus es, silicernium. ,

23. Tcmtwmne ab re tua-st oti tibi. Bentley adopts this reading from
the Bembine MS.. and from the passage in Cic. Lib. xii. ad Att., where
it is noted. Lindenbrog. quotes for ver. 24, a line of Menander, ἅ μὴ
*epacaret μήτ’ Move, μήτ’ ὅρα.

25. Homo mm, ἀει, “ Ι am a man3 and (as such) deem nought that
befalls mankind indifferent to me.” “ 1 have a kinsman's interest in
the weal or woe of all men.'' He alludes to aliena ut eures, in the words
of Menedemus. Cicero touches upon this noted passage in his Offices,
i. 9 ; De Fin. iii. 193 De Leg. i. 12. Compare Seneca, Ep. 95.
Angustia. Ep. 51.

27. Rectum eet? Consti-ue, “Is it right'l then let me inquire, that I
may do the same ,· Is it wrong? let me be supposed to advoehe you, that 1
may dissuade yon from it.’' Ut faciam refers to percontari, ut deterream
to monere. For deterreo in the sense of dissuade, cf. Adelph. Ι. ii. 64,
‘⁶ Advorsor sedulo et deterreo.” Plant. Mil. Glor. ΙΙ. iii. 61, and
II. iv. 16, 17, quoted by Gronovius.

28. Mihi sie est um, “I have need to do thus.'’ For this use of .
