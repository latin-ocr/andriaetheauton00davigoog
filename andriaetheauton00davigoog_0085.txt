ANDRIA. 71

16. Omnes sihi malle mlius, ὣο. Menander, φιλεῖ δ’ ἑαυτοῦ πλεῖον
οὐδεῖς οὐδένα. “ Malle melius esse‚” there is here a redundaney of eom-
parativee. “Quam '⁹ will depend on “ malle ’⁹ or ‘⁶ melius.”

18. Quo oeqmbr sum Pamphilo, “And therefore Ι am the less
disposed to find fault with Pamphilus. '’—oeqoeuae‘m' = minus iniquus.—
Maniai videre. Memini, says Ruhnken, generally is followed by a
present tense to prevent the concurrence of two perfecta—Quo is i.· q.
quare. See Adelph. IV. v. 46. -In somnis, at night. Virg. Georg. i.
208. Plaut. Merep 11. i. 2--Inv 20, malum deest ‘do mea mischiefP
—pro hoc male, for this ill news.

ACTUS IL-So. VI.

Smo tries to sound Davus respecting the sentiments of Pamphilus.
Davus puts him off with the notion that his son ’s disquietude, if he
has any, arises from the shabby preparatione for his nuptiale. Simo,
however, misdoubts the slave· s explanation.

Metre: Iambic Trimeter.

2. Ea. ‚qr-atio, h. .⁰· Ejus gratiffi‘ ‘for that causel’ Attraetion of
the pronoun into the case of gratia.1>arry quotes Plaut. Bacch. Ι. i.
64 Sne„ Ter. Eun. Ι. li. 19, and ἐμὴν χάριν from the Greek..

3. AEque quicquam numo quidem.. Perizonius explains this‘ ‘nunc
quidem oeque quicquam narro ac narro tunc, cum nil narro. '’ AEque
seems to be 1. q. aeque ac. “Nothing more than common at present.’'
Itis an euphemism for‘ ‘ni1‚” as is seen from the next verse.

5. Hoc male habet virum, “This vexes our great manl’ Virmn is
spoken in irony. With male habet compare V. iv. 37, At mihi unus
scrupulus restat qui me male habet. In v. 6 Potin es is the fuller form
of potesne. Possum is i. q. potis sum· potes: potis es: potest:
potis est. And so all the verb possum may be resolved into eum.
the indeclinable adj. potia (potior, potissimus), and the substantive
verb. Lindenbr. quotes Menander’s verse:

ἀεί κράτιστόν ἐστι τ’ ἀληθῆ λέγειν.

Adelph. IV. .,32 consuevit. Bentley read here‘ ‘Propter hospital·

hosp itae, h. c. As Parry observes, there are two licenses herein: the
shoroening the last syllable of propter and the use of ai for oe—neither
of them Terentian usageS. The reading followed in the text was
suggested by Ritschel‘ ιιι his preface to Plautus. Consti-ue “ Are these

the Vatican Codex has‘ ‘Eam seeum ipse rem reeta reputavit via.” The
older reading appears to have been‘ Etenim ipsun seeum eam rem
reputavit vial’ Bentley rejected seeum, and placed recta after rem,
following Faernus. Parry suggests “ Etenim ipsus secum recta reputavit
