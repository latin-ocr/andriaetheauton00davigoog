Asyndeton. See Madvig. Gr. sect. 434.—Nihil vident, “ They look to
nothing,'’ ‘⁶ consider nothing.”

31. Vincor, ‘⁸ 1 am convinoed.” cf. Phorm. ΙΙΙ. ἰὶ. 16, Hei veris
vincon—Nm te hoo obsecro, dvc„ ’ὃ Now Ι entreat this of you, that,
seeing your mind is naturally graver and more considerate than mine,
there may be some shield for my folly in your justice.” Bentley's
wholesale 'alteration of the text here needs only to be recorded,
“ Quanto tu me es annis gravior, tanto es ignoscentior ;” “ es ” being
the imperative mood. A recent emendation, ‘⁸ quando ’⁹ for “ quanto ''
commends itself much more to our teste: With “ ignoscentior” Ruhn-
νῗξῡιι cofffareaf‘ Quo quis enim major, magis est placabilis irae.” Ov.

rist. . v. 3 .

34. Factum iynoscam. The usual construction after “ignosco '' is a
dative of the person, and an accusative of the offence. Here, and at
Plaut. Amphitr. I. i. 101, “ Ignoscamus peccatum suum,” we have only
an accusative of the offence. In v. 36, qua causi)¹ is i. q. cujus causa.

36. Misere omnes numus Raliyioeae, ‘⁴ Wretchedly superstitious as we
all are.’' An early edition before us reads ‘⁶ misere ;’' most editors
‘⁶ miserae.” The formeris far preferable—Ne expers partis, &c., Su-
perstition forbad that children should die without having possessed
some part of their inheritance (Dacier).-—Istuc recte, said ironically.

41. Quam Bacchis—Quid ea nav-rat. Here the relative clause is put
before the antecedent. The construction is almost as in Virg. AEn. i.
573, Urbem quam statuo vestra esu—Smandum mihi dedit. For this
custom Ruhnken refers to Ovid Am. 11. xv. 23,

Me gere, cum calidis perfunderis imbribus artus,
Damnaque sub gemma perfer euntis aquae.

46. Si potis est reperiri. Petis est is i. q. potest (rest sc.). See Andr.
ΙΙ. vi. 6, note. For nostrast in v. 47, compare “O noster chreme,·’ in
Andr. V. ii. 5.— Ut Μαίων, “ Thac inquiry may be made? Quoeratur
is used impersonally.

52. Olim in tollenda, So Goveanus and most earlier editors, Parry
follows them here. Zeune and others read ‘⁶ tollendo?

AGTUS IV.—Sc. ΙΙ.

Snus soliloquises on the awkward position in which this business
places him. How is he to avert the detection of Bacchis? How to get

the money, if that indeed is not now past hope? By degrees he reasons
himself into confidence of success, in spite of his difficulties.

Metre :—Iambic Tetrameter. ’

1. Read “ haud permultum ” with Bentley and Part-y.

2. In anymtwm oppido nwnc meae coqwntwr copim, ‘⁴ So completely by
this circumstance are my forces driven into a narrow pass.” A metaphor
from an army, which has got into a defile‚ and cannot extricate itself.
