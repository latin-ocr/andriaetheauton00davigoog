Cf. Eun. V. viii. 46, where either an accusative is understood, as here;
or in both ceses we must take zui nunptilnoe ιο be a double dative,
like ‘⁶ relicta est huic arrhaboni,” in ΙΙΙ. iii. 42. Ruhnken prefers this
lacten—Ad meroe ndis, cf. Ι. i. 36, “ I ehell really be obliged ιο have
recouree ιο the rakee.”— Vere, in eamoet.-Incommoditaeec. Cf. Andr.
111. iii. 36.

that pardon will be given with a bad grace? Cf. ΙΙ. iii. 21, Quom
gratum mihi eeee potuit, nolui—Et yma· a adfines placent. Cf. IV.
viii. 24, Generum placere.

64. Quid dotis . . . dixisse. “Dotem dicere‚” according ιο Ruhnken was
equivalent ιο “ ιο settle. the dower.” He quotes, Ov. Faet- vi. 394, a
reference which 1 cannot verify. We may, however, add Plaut. M. G.
111. i. 113, “ Mea bona cognatis dicam,” which is nearly the same.

66. Nc quid vereare, ei· minuo, “ Don't fear, if ἰι be emaller than
one might expect.”—Movet, “influencee me.” Cf. Andr. 111. ii. 36.-
Pro rc mewa, “ For my station-in-life‚” ‘⁸ In proportion ιο my
estate.”

71. Quen eye veo-o, δια, “Nay, but really 1,·’ διο. Byom? uc ejus
animwm, δια, “Don’t you know why 1 do it? ιο restrain hie spirit,
which now indulges in luxury and wantonnees‚ and ιο bring him ιο

here, in Livy. II. 33, and Phaedrue IV. xxii. 21, “ Satis profecto retudi
superbiam.”—For diffluit (properly said of a river overflowing ite banke),
see Cic. Off. i. 30, Quam eit. turpe diffluere luxuria. Pers. Sat. iii. 20,
“Diffluie amene.” ·

74. Germ mihi morena, ‘⁸ ιο pleaee myeelf.” See Andr. 1. ii. 17,
1v. i. 17. “

76. Dictis confutabitur, ‘⁶ shall be corrected with words, as ’tis meet.
children should be.” Calpurnius seems ιο have taken mem for ‘⁸ free
men'’ ae opposed ιο “ serv-ow ‘⁴ confuto '' was properly ιο prevent
water from boiling over by pouring in cold water with a ladle3 th.
‘⁴ futiess’ a water-vessel, akin ιο “fundo :'’ see Smith’s Dior.. and Donald· ’
son Varron. cap. xii. 2, ad fin. p. 377. From this first senec comes
the idea of ηψπ-6381118, as “ confutare dolores? Cic. Tunc. Diep. v. 31.
Phorm. ΠΙ. i. 13, Confutavit verbis admodum iratum senem.

77. Sed Syrum. Mun. Quid eum? Cn. Eyone, ὼο. “But as ιο
Syrus. What of him ‘3” qunet “ What will I do with him'z Why,
ae l'm alive '⁹ (cf. Andr. V. ii. 25). Adeo exornatum dabo, “ I’ll eo dress
him.” of. Adelph. IL i. 22, “Ornatus eeeee ex tuis virtutibus ;’' and for
‘⁴ dabo” thus with the past participle: eee Andr. IV. ii. 20, Effectum
reddam. Adeo depeaeum, ·‘ so trim him.” Plaut. Menaechm. 915 (Hild-
yard) usee the same metaphor, Pecto puym‘r, “ dress ’e'm well with your
fiste‚” Theocr. Id. v. 119, Εὖμάρας ἐκάθηρε, “ Eumaree dueted your
jacket.” See notes in Bohn’e Translation of Theocr. ad loc.

80. Vidua ’,κυλίοι-ι’, “ ιο a lone woman,'’ not necessarily “ a widow.'’
Vidua is from the roob ‘·id·’ or “fid,” for which compare “divido‚”
“idus'' and “itue,’' “the division of the month,” Hor. Od. IV. xi. 14.
