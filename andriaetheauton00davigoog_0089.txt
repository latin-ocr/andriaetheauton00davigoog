opus the ablativa of a participle is osten used (Opus est maturate. Liv.
i. 58.) See Madvig. 266, obs, See below at verse, 43 of this scene.

(Hildyard), 614. Quid, tandem admisi in me ut loqui non audeam?

13. Saltem accurate (me fallere debuisti), “ You ought at any rate to
play your trieks on me carefully, so that, if Ι should have found you
out, 1 might at least seem to be feared.” “ Accurate ” seems to be opposed
to “aperte.” “ It was unwise to play your tricks so openly. You should
have been more guarded.” Stalbaum’s idea that acetvrate is the second
person plural of securo, is worthless. -

16. Interminatus sum, &c., “I forbad you with threats to do it.’' cf.
Ter. Eun. V. i. 14. 'Phe “ inter,'’ in composition with minor, may signify
“ “ graviter? as in internecium, interbib0, interimo, &c- Intermino is
found in Plaut. Mil. ΘΙ. ΙΙ. iii. 42—de retulit! ‘⁴ What did it boot 2 ’⁹
from refert. v. impers. Phorm. IV. iii. 41, Parvi retulit non suscepisse.
In v. 17, Credon, is the present for the future. See Menaeeh. Plaut.

habeo,1 have it, Ι know.

19. Quasi non tihi cicc wnwnoiatum, hoec aicfore. Bentley. But there

, is no difficulty in the text as it stood. In the next verse Bentley's

reading Mihin quicquam! ‘⁴ What, has anything been told me 2⁹⁹ is very
probable. The old man, Simo, is jealous of the· idea that he has been
helped to discover the mare’s nest.

21. Nam qui istoec, δια, “ Why how did that suspicion of yours occur
to ou 3⁹³

252. Quasi tu dicae, h. e. As though you meant. Dicere = velle,
significare: as in Eun. IV. v. 10, and Phorm. I. ii. 54, where dicere·
= putares.— Certe enim acvb, Why, I’m certain of it! Enim (γάρ).
Non satie me peu-owni etiam, qualia sim. You do not yet thoroughly
know my nature. Etiam. Ι. i. 89, Nil etiam suspicans mali. Donatus
quotes Virgil, AEn. vi. 485, Idaeumque etiam currus, etiam arma
tenentem.

24. Dari verba. cf. Ter. Andr. I. iii. 6, Cui verba dare difficile est.
Muttire literally “ to say ‘ mu,' ’' hence our wordto mutter. cf. Plaut.

ullum verbum muttit. Pers, Sat. i. 119, Mcn' muttire nefas.

27 . This is Bentley’s collocation of the words. The ordinary reading
is, deferent puerum huc ante ostium—Nilo setius is i. q. nihilo secius.

ι Illico is ‘⁴ directly” “on the spot.'’ Cf. eloco in Plaut. Menaechm. 359, 500,
Aulul. 54. . There can be no doubt that the verses from Audivi to
nuptioe, 31-—36‚ are rightly placed in the mouth of Davus. Davus
would naturally state fiction as truth, Simo would not.

35. Et puerum. ut adservet simul. “And to bring withal a baby.”
Nihil, move-nram· nuptioe. “ There’s no impediment to the wedding.’'
Goveanus translates “impediri non possunt nuptiae.’' Moventur is not
i. q. differuntur, are postponed‚ as Donatus supposed.
