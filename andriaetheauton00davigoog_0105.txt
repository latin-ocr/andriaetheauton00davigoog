which “illudo '⁹ governs a dative. Ruhnken’s explanation seems more
satisfactory, Feci ut fama et existimatio filiae ludibrio esset aliis3 for
which sense of “illudo ” see Ter. Phorm. V. vii. 22. This, too, is the
view Gronovius takes—For vita, meaning ‘⁴ all that makes life dear,”
see Ter. Heaut. 11. iii. 74.

8. Remittasjam, δια, “You would cease at length.’' So Hor. od. ΙΙ.

With Homini adulescentulo, in ver. 9, compare “ Mulier meretrix,'' in
IV. iv. 16.

11. In seditionem, “ to domestic discords,'’ (th. sse-de, Parry).
Ruhnken quotes Cic. Att. ii. 1, Mulier seditiosa, and Parry adds
Plaut. Amphitr. Ι. ii. 15, Τιιιιι meus pater eam seditionem in· tran-
quillum conferet. —Eyus labore, &c.,‘ ‘that by trouble to her,’' διο. For
this sense of‘ ‘,’'labor see below, at V. ii. 29, Tantum laborem capere ob
talem filium.

13. Imepi, like Incepi adire, at ver. 2,‘ ‘I under-took it whilst cir-
