my best'' (sedulo = sine dolo).—-Melim (sc. consilium).—Mc misam face,
‘⁸ Give me my dismissal.” See V. i. 14, Nos -missos face. Phorm. V.
viii. 53, Missum te facimus. ·

57. Cupio, “ 1 would it were eof—Reatina in quem mc accepisti loom.
Bentley altered this line into ‘⁴ Restitue quem a me,” &a But, as Ruhn-
ken observes, the former reading is quite satisfactory, and must be
explained as a Graecism (a case of atti-action), being equivalent to
‘⁶ Restitue me in illum locum in quo me accepisti‚” ‘⁸ Place me again
where you found me.” He compares Livy, i. 29, Raptim quibus quis·
qug9pogemmrat ΘΙἪια Glycerio octium. Greek doors opened outwards,
and comere-out rapped the door inside, to appi-ize passere-by. Hence
the frequent phrase ot} the text (see Hecyra 1v. i. 6 ; Phorm. V. v, 12).
A Glycerio, Compare Mil. Gl. (Plaut.) ΙΙ. i. 76, Foris concrepuit hinc
a vicino sena—Nil ad te, “ No business of —yours.”—Quoero, “ 1 'm oon·
sidering,” or “ devising.”—Hem nwncin’ demum! ‘⁴ What now, at last ἲ “’
—Inventm dabo, h. e. inveniam. cf. Eun. 11. i. ⁷, Effectum debe, i. q.
efficiam, Ruhnken.

cerium, and Charinus goes home to await Davus with news. Mysis
awaits DavuS, who has gone into Glycerium’s house.

explains malum, amor meus, or Glycerii solicitudo. But it seems
rather to have reference to Davus’s mismanagement, which is pro-
