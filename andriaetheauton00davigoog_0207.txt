21. Ilicet. Ne te admisce, “ You had better be off. Don’t implicate
yourself.” For “iliona’' see Eun. 1. i. 9, 11. iii. 56. Phorm. Ι. iv. 30.
Plaut. Epid. V. ii. 19. For “admisce,” above, IV. v. 35, Ne me admisceas.
—Nec tu amaon tibi. Nec precatorem pararis, “ Nor need you to provide
a sanctuary, nor intercessor for yonrself.” “Slaves,” says Gronovius,
“ used to fly for refuge to an altar, or to suborn an intercessor, and so
evade their masters' wrath.” For the use of “ ara,'' in such cases, he
quotes Plaut. Most. V. i. 45, Ego interim hanc aram occupabo, Rud.
111. iii. 26, Ne, inquam, time te ι assidete hic in ara. Eur. Androm. “
ἔχει ’γὰρ καταφυγὴν, θήρ μεν πέτραν, δοῦλοι δε βωμοὺς θεῶν. Ovid. Ep. i.
110. For “ precatorem‚” see Ter. Phorm. I. ii. 90, Ad precatorem
adeam credo, διο. Plaut. Asin. ΙΙ. iv. 9, Atque is precator assit,
malam rem effugies nunquam.'’· Epid. V. ii. 20, Te profecte, Apaecides,
Nihil moror mihi precatorem Pseud. Π. ιι. 12.

24. Nec tibi, nec tibi. Syrus and Clitipho. This is the reading of
Faernus, approved by Bentley, who illustr-ates it by Plaut„ Oapt. II. ιιι.
87, Et tua et tua ornatus reveniam ex sententia. The common reading
is, Neo tibi, mo kuic. —Ita nos alienavit, “ ΗΘ has so cast me off.”
‘⁴ Alieno,'' is i. q. “e familis ejici0,” Cf. Liv. xli. 8, N Θ quis quem civitatis
mutandae causa suum faceret, neve alienaret3 and see below, V. iv. 6,
Alienum—Tibi jam ad sororem esse intelliqtz (cibum: sc). “You‚ 1
undgrstand, will still find a meal at your sister's.” Ad here ²⁸2³· q.

28. Modo liceat viva-e (Sc. sio—Nos esurituros satis! An answer παρὰ
προσδοκίαν, “ If we are but let live, there ’s a prospect ”—Cnm
what‘l” SYR. “⁸0f abundant hunger.’'

30. Ibi nmw amn. Cf. ΙΙΙ. i. 63.-The phrase is equivalent to “in e

9, n ⁸ n
sug-11,- Niga ‘agdi-it lonqius, “My advice shall not be very long absent '' (sc.
comdium).—N‹m esse horum te arbitror (filium sc.) “ I don't think you
belong to these people.'' Said with a sneer.

33. Eyo dicam, quod mihi in mentem. Most editions and MSS. read
‘⁸ in mentem est‚’' here and at Adelph. IV. i. 12, and Plaut. Amph. ΙΙ.
ιι. 'za—A phrase which, no doubt, arose from the habit of using the accu-
sative after ‘⁶ venit.’' The best course, however, is to omit “ est,” in
which case we may supply “ venit ” in sensa—Te indulqebant, an
ancient construction for “ tibi indulgebant.'’ Cf. Eun. ΙΙ. i. 16, Nimis
me indulged—Filia—vem—-te expellerent. Tbere is an antithesis here
between the real daughter, and te, the supposititious son.

40. Awaio im patema injur-ia Βοῶνα esse, “And a source of assistance
to them when fathers are harsh” ‘⁴ or unjust'’——Cf. Injuriae parentum,
Ι. ιι. 30.-Id nonfit. “ That is not done in this imtcmce.” “ Ergo, Sostrata
is not your mother,” is his line of inference.

43. Awt scibis quojus ris. For the form “ scibis,” see above, IV. vi.
20, “Experibere,” and the note thera—Namque adolescem, quam minima
in spe situs erit, Tam, ἀο. .“ For the more desperate the young man’s
position, the more easily will he reconcile his father’s forgiveness to his
own terms.” Among a variety of readings of the 44th line, the least
common is that of Fleckeisen, “ nam quam maxime huic vana haec
suspicio Erit; '⁹ but it is too great a liberty with the text of MSS. For
“ quam ” and ‘⁴ tam '' thus used with superlative instead of comparative,
Parry refers to. Sallust, Jugurth. 31, “ Quam quisque pessime feeit,
