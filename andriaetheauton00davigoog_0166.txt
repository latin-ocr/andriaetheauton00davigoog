here will be efficient in point of eloquence‚ just so far as the poet
(ille) has becn in finding ideas aptly to his purpose,” διο. ΗΘ means to
say the main credit is the poet’s‚ the speaker can merely enforce the
poet's words by his delivery. ’

16.'Nam quod rumores, διο. Nam, see Andr. I. i. 24. As to the
