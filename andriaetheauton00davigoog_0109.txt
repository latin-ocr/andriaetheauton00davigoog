8. Facias (oportet, se.,) “ Oug ht you to do these things with im-
punity3' ·—Hic, at Athens. —Insrwdem ἰἰιι·ἰσίε,ι ‘tempt into mischief.'’
Cf. Virg. AEn. x. 72, Quis deus in fraudem, &o.: and Servius, on that

passage. Bentley omits the note of interrogation at inlici-3, and places ·

a comma at sollicitando. —Lactaa ef. IV. i. 24.

10. Meretrioioe amores nuptiis cmbminasst ‘Gement (solder· ·,up

the stranger won ’t stand ῡ1ιίε,” or‘ ‘stand his groundl'

Heaut. ΙΙ. iv. .‚13 Hi se ad vos applicant.Plau12 Menaechm. 256
(Hild y.ard) From Cicero de Orat. i. 39, it seems that such a patron
as the father of Chrysis would become to the shipwreeked stranger,
had a claim on him, and on his property, if he died intestata. ——Itan'

49, Sine tamen, ne me obturba3 88 tace.
