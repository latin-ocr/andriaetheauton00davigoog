appear to be used as the locative genitive„ or dative, unleoe in
conjunct-‚ion with ⁴⁴ domi. ’' Ruhnken, however, considers belli here,
to stand for‘ ‘in belloss' as Militiae, Adelph. ΙΙΙ. iv. 49. ὲ-Δᾱιο
res redit, “The matter came to this pointf’ i. q. ⁴eo res rediitss’
Comp are Phorm. I. ii. 5, Adeo res redit. In verse 63, one MS. has

“sapientia,’' but benevolentia is the better reading, and, as Bentley
observes, as plus scire has reference to oetatem, so providere has to
benevolenftiam.

64. Ad reqemst ‘to the great king:” the King of Persia, as Zeune
rightly shows· , for the plote and language of these plays are bon-owed
from more ancient plays and more ancient history.

68. Non meremini, “spirited’' Plaut. Most. I. ii. 23.-Qm: fuere ei
conscii. So Bentley, ⁴⁴ Who were his confidants.'' Perhaps ⁴‘ profec-
tionis'' is understood as the genitive of the thing. In verse 71, incerto
proe (1391·1213111713,ί ‘unsettled, owing to sickness of heartl’ Prae expresses
a preventing cause. See Madvig. sect. 255, obs. 1, and Parry on
Andr. V. i. 6. Here itis the⁴ ‘aegritudo” which prevents the speaker' s

, mind from being‘ ‘certus.”

72. Αειιιῑάο,ι ‘I seat myselfl' Plaut. Bacch. III. iii. 28. —soccos decra-
hum, “yThe draw off my slippersl' The Soccus was peculiar to
comedy y, the Cothurnus to tragedy. In verse 73, Bentley proposed to
read ⁴⁴ inde 3111,” because ubi video occurs three lines below. We
retain Video aliea—Lectos sternere, ⁴⁴ spreading the couches‚'' three of
which formed a “.triclinium ’' See Hor. Sat. 1. iv. 86.

74. Pro se quisque sedulo faciebat, dcc„ “Each was busy ιιι doing his
utmostss' Gronovius compares Plaut. Amphit. Ι. 1. 76, Pro se quisque,
id quod quisque potest et valet, edit. Livy vii. 32, Ferociter pro se
quisque signum duces poscere.

77. The MSS. and older editions have sumt, which Bentley seems to
us to have altered to‘ ‘sint’' without good grounds. For Med solius
cama, compare Madvig. sect. 297α; Cic. Phil. ii. 43, Tuum, hominis
simplicis. pectus vidimus. Parry quotes the parallel use in Greek. .
Soph. OEd. 001. 344, τάμὰ δυστήνου κακά, &c. See the Greek Grammar¹
of King Edward V’1., sect. 145, obs. Latin Grammar, sect. 154. In 81,
ad hoec utenda, we no’te the gerundivo governing an accusative, like an
ordinary transitive verb ; just as utor, abutor, fungor, δια, often do in
the older poets. See Madvig. 265, obs. 2. See also above, Ι. 1. 13,
and Adelph. V. iii. 29, Mea-utantur sine.

84. Vitam illam cdlet vhwpcm, “Shall lead that life of neediness.”
ef. Plaut. Trinumm. III. ii. 74, Nec quicquam hic tibi sit, qui vitam
colas—Illi de me supplicium daha, ‘⁴ Ι will punish myself for him.”
Parry observes that ‘⁴ usque dum—interea usque” must be construed
much as if it had¹ been merely written⁴ ‘dum—interea.”

89. Nec vas nec vcstiwaentumst ‘Neither furniture nor coveringss ⁹·Ruhn
ken compares Sall. Catil. 51 Vasa colligere. Vestimemum appears to
refer to the hangings or coverings of the couches, &c See Hor. Sat. 11.
iv. 84, for a similar use of the word‘ ‘vestis-⁹ '—0003rasi ommia, “I
scraped everything together. ” Compare Adelph. II. ii. 34. Decem
minas conradet alicunde.

91, 92. Facile sumptum exercerent swam, “Gould easily work out their
charges” Muretus, followed by Gronovius, read‘ ‘victum exercerent'’
The latter explains the phrase‘ ‘facile tantum fructuum domino para·
