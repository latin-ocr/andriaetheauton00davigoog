11. Dum molimur, deam conantur, annue est. ’ὅ While they are
getting ready, while they are making the attempt (sc. ‘ ire: ιο start), a
year elapses.” The reading ‘⁶ molliuntur” is very far-fetched. For
“ conantur,'’ Servius on Virg. AEn. iv, 133, seems to have been read
“ cunctantur” here. Another reading is “ comuntur’' (compare Plaut.
Stich. V. iv. 19), “are dressing their hair,” but this is of the same
character as “ molliuntur? and may be discarded. For ‘⁴ annus est,”
Parry refers to Eun. IV. v. 8, «Iamdudum, aetatem. And westerhoV.
quotes ovid. Ex. Pont. 111. iv. 59, ‘⁴ Dum venit huc rumor, propera-
taque carmina flunt, Faetaque eunt ad vos, annus abisse potest.’'

12. Ile-spira, “Breathe again? “Take courage.” A man out of
heart was said to be ‘⁶ exanimatus.” See An'dr. 1. i. 104. Tibi, “ for
your comfort? the dativus commodi.

AOTUS IL—Sc. 111.

Enna Syrus and Dromo on their return, Antiphila, Bacchis, and
their baggage not being far behind. Clinia is disturbed to find how
much of worldly goods his mistress seems to have uired ‘in his
absence. Syrus undeceives him, and shows him that Antiphila is still
devoted to him. All the packages, all the money, maidens, and dresses,
dvc„ belong to Bacchis, Clitipho's mistress, whom Syrus, ιο his annoy-
ance when he first hears it, has brought home. Syrus details his plan,
to pass off Bacchis for Clinia’s mistress, while Antiphila is entrusted to
Clitipho’s mother. He persuades the two young men to acquiesce in
this scheme, and -ιο act it out carefully. His reasons he will give
another time.

1. Sermones cadimus. Muretus says that this phrase is derived from
the Greek, and refers ιο Priscian lib. xviii, where nebu-mv λόγους,
nemeis! ῥήματα are quoted. But Servius, at AEn. vi. 159, Multa—vario
sermone serebant, would read “ serimus '⁹ here.

4. Minime mirum, adeo impeditae ma. “ No wonder that they are
left behind ε they are so encumbered with baggage ;” a metaphor, says
Gronovius, from the ‘⁶ impedimenta? of an army. He quotes a
remarkable passage from Cic. pro Milone, c. 20, “Cum alter veheretur in
rheda paenulatus, una sederet uxor: quid horum non impeditissimum,
vestitus, an vehiculum, an comesv’ The opposite ιο “ impeditus”
was ‘⁶ expeditus.” See Cic. in Mil. xxi, ‘⁸ Iter expediti latronis cum
Milonis impedimentis comparate.” —- Ancillarwm yreqem, “a troop of
maidens.” Lindenbr. quotes οἷκέτων &yellus-f from chrysostom, in
Taul. ad Ephes. c. 6, Hom. 20.

6. Portam quid rerum! ‘⁸ They are bringing a power of baggage !”
Quid rerum = “ rerum magnam copiam.’' As in Andr. IV. iv. 6,
