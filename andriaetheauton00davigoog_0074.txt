3. Astu, abl. of astus, “ cunningly.” See Plaut. Pers. Ι. 111. 68, Prae·
cipe astu ffliae, quae fabuletur. Me aut herum pessumdabunt, “ will
bring me or my master to the dogs.” Pessum = pedes versum, though
Parry ,would derive it from βυσσὸς, Ion. for βυθὸς. See Rudens II.
vi. 23, &c.; Mostell. V. ii. 49. .

5. Illum, ejm, h. e. Pamphilus.--'Hnju⁸‚ Simo. In v. 6, verba dare
= “ to impose upon,” a common phrase in Plautus and Terence. See
Hildyard’s Glossary to Plaut. Menaeohm. 553 Aul. 23, “ Dare verba,'’ is
equivalent to Verba tantum (et nihil ultra) dare. Dari facete verba
custodi catae3 Menaechm. l. c. Compare Ter. Eun. IV. v. 1.

7. Servat, h. e. observat. So ovid Met„ Caetera servabant, atque in
statione manebant. It seems to us that “ primum jam” in v. 6, is
answered by “Ad haec mala hoc mi accedit” in v. 10.

8. Aut si quam lubitwm fuerit causam ceperit. Bentley reads, aut

“or, if he pleases, he will at once seize on some excuse ;’' but there
seems no reason here to take ceperit as the fut. exact. for the simple
future. If we read with Pan-y, and place a comma at fuerit, it will be
easy to suppose a. copulative conjunction omitted between fremit and
ceperim ‘⁴ Or, if he so plesse, and has but gotten him some excuse,
he will throw me, &c.'' This mode of construction we prefer to

Ο .
αό9ῗῂρτιο jwre quaque injur-id. Bentley reads, “ Qua jure qual me injurie?
against the testimony of all the copies. He takes qua—qua (both—
and) to be used as in Livy often, and in Plaut. Trinumm. n . iii. 38, for
tum—tum. But there is no need of this. Quo and qua are the inde-
finite pronouns, i. q. aliquo, alique. construe “ Right or wrong.”

13. Amentiwm haud amantimn. A case of the figure “ paronomasia?
Shakespeare, K. John, iii. 1, N.

“ Ο lawful let it be,
That I have roem, with Rome to curse awhile.’·

14. decreverunt tollere, “ they have decided to acknowledge and bring
up as their own.'’ The custom was, to lay an· infant before his fat-her's

, feet. If 110 decided that it should be reared, “ tollebat ;” if not,

“ relinquebat? Compare the use of suscipere below, ΙΙ. 111. 27, Nam
pollicitus sum suscepturum. Tollo is used thus in Hecyra, IV. iv. 82,
Nam puerum injussu credo non tollent meo. Heaut. IV. i. 143 Plaut.
Amph.‘I. 111. 3,· Hor. Sat. I. x. 51, II. v. 45. In the next line, as
Parry notes, thepccent of the preposition is on the last syllable, be-
cause followed by an enclitic.

16. Civem Atticam esse hanc. In which case Pamphilus was legally
bound to marry hen—Ruit olim . . . mortem: all this, as well as from
“ Ibi tum ” to “ parvam,” is in the “ obliqua orati0.'’ Madvig. Gr.
ξ 403; Livy i. 9.—Obiit mortem, “ died.” cf. Plaut. Aul. Prol. 15;
Virg. AEn. x.·641. Sometimes the verb is used without mortem, as in
Hor. Od. ΙΙΙ. ix. 24 3 often with “diem mpremum.”-ejectam, “cast
ashore.'' Cf. Virg. AE'n. iv. 374. -

19. Fabulce, “ mere lies !” Heaut. ΙΙ. 111. 96.
