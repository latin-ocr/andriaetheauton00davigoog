p35. Mirando Ῑιοσ tanto, tam repentium bono, ‘⁴ While 1 marvel. at this
so great, so sudden blessing.” Mis-amolo is the gerundive, denoting the
muner (while, so that something occurs at the same time), See
Madvig. Gr. 416, obs. 1.-Mulcimodu, “For many reasons? See Heaut-
ΙΙ. iii. 793 Phorm. 111. i. 1.

37. Mihi unus scrupulus etiam restat, ‘⁸ But 1 have still one doubt
left.” Festus defines scrupus to be “ saxum asperum et difficile con·
trectatu.” Hence scrupulus, “a pebble,’' hurtiug the foot in walking;
, and in a secundm-y sense, a difficulty or doubt. Cic. ad Att. i. 18,
Aculeos omnes et scrupulos occultabo. Plin. Ep. vi. 8, Exime hunc
illi scrupulum. Ter. Phorm. V. viii. 303 Adelph. IL ii. 20, Injeci
scrupulum homiui.

38. Dignus α, Oum tud νάἰρίωω, odium, Such appears to be the
best accredited MSS. reading, which involves the difficulty of odi-om,
an accusative after dimme, which governs the ablativo. Parry taken
digmus tc be i. q. meritus, and so to govern an accusative, as in Phorm.
111. ii. 84, Di tibi omnes, id quod es dignus duint: but there the
relative may be the accusative, as attracted to the case of the ante-
cedent; and at Plaut. Capt. V. ii. 16, and Pseud.. IV. i. 26, Nam· si

sider the ablativa of the rate of value, at which Chremes is rated, to be
omitted by aposiopesis—“ You deserue, hateful follow, with those
scruples of yourS,”——This is not very satisfactory, but it is hard to find
an exact parallel to odium governed by diynun, among those cited by
Parry, and Smith’s Lexicon.—Nodum in 43σὺῬο quoeris, ‘⁶ You look for a
knot in a bulrush : ’⁹ a proverb, of attempting impossibilities. See
Plaut. Menoechm. 164 (Hildyard), In scirpo nodum quaeris. Aulul.
1V.,i. 9, Scirpea ratis. Festus, according to Gronovius, quotes a line of
Ennius, Quaerunt in scirpo, soliti quod dicere, nodum.

myself,” colmam—Quod qam-is in ver. 42,·is i. q. nomen quod qum-is.

46. De utrm-e, “ As regards the wife.’' So in Adelph. 11. i. 50, De
argent0, somnium—Ita ut possedi, “ As 1 ’ve possessed myself of her,
will Chremes make no alteration? i. e., will he confirm the marriage ’ὲ
If we read a note of interrogation, we must. suppose the present mutat
to be for the future. Ροεεαίἰ, says Parry, is lang-uage borrowed from
