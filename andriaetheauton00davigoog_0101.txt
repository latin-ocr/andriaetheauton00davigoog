Aorus IV.—so. IV. ’

CHREMES, returning to Simo’ s house to announce that all is ready
for the marriage, comes upon Mysis and the baby. From Mysis, whom
. he questions, he gets no answer, and so retires to listen to the dispute
between Davus and Mysis3 from whose conversation he arrives at the
fact that the child is that of Pamphilus, though Davus pretends not
ιο believe it. Ηο hurries off ιο Simo, to break off the nuptiale
again, while Davus remains on the stage to explain his conduct to
M sis.

there 2 Quid hominum ιε ιιι effect equivalent to“ quot hominos? hence
the plural verb. Gronovius compares Plaut. Paenu1.111.ii1.5.Sed

amona cara est, “ Oh, to be sure, the market ’s up.”—Quid dicam aliud,

8. Qua· hoec est fabula 2 “ What farce is this ²” Colman.

12. Dictura est ’quod r0902‘ ‘Are you going ιο say what 1 ask 3 ”—
Au is an expression of confusion. Davus then, aside, motione Mysis
ιο come nearer ιο the right, so as to be more out of Chremes's way,
and ιο hear any asido speeches.

13. Delio-as, “'You re mad! —'Non tute ipsc (aeide),‘ ‘did not you

bring ιι yourself. ‘2⁹’
Verbum ai mihi. ,saxia cave, “beware of saying one word ιο ιιιο

beyond what 1 ask you. ’' Bentley omitted si, to make the passage
bear this interpretation, of which ιι seems capable with si retained.
But the more general way of translating the passage as it stands, is
that of Parry, and most modern editores ‘If you say a single word
more than Ι ask you, bewaress'
