Annum. 77

Ausculta: paucis et quid te ego velim et quod tu quaeris scies. There
is no need of any emendation.

6. Per ιι deos oro. For this insertion of the pronoun between the
proposition and the case governed by ‘it in adjurations, Gronovius⁸
quotes Mostell. (Plaut.) IV. i. 67, Nunc te ego per genua obsecro.
Livy xxiii. 9. Per ego te, fili, quaecunque jura liberos jungunt paren-
tibus, precor quaesoque. Parry observes that the phrase arose from
the Greek πρός σε τῶν θεῶν.

7. Δ parvis, Cf. Ι. i. 8, A parvolo ut semper tibi, &e Quoius, in
ν. 9, is the old form of cuj us.

12. Quasi hoc te orwndo a me impetrare oporteat. Quasi has here, as
Ruhnken observes, a negative force. “As if you ought” = ‘⁸ you ought
not, to gain this from me by entreaty.’' so, V. iii. 19, “Quasi tu hujus
indigeas patris ’⁹ is, i. q. “ You do not need a father such as I am :’'
and so in ΙΙ. v. 6, above. Alium atque, ‘⁴ other than? So Cicero, ad
Fam. 11. 3, Aliter atque ostenderam facio. See Madv. Gr. 444.

14. δί in remst utrique, &c- ‘⁴ If ’tis for the interest of both.” Of.

Hecyra, 1. ii. 27, Ita Di Deaeque faxint, si in rem cst Bacchidis—In ,

commune ut comulas (v. 16): “To consult our common interests.”
Ruhnken quotes Liv. xxiv. 22, Undique consuli in medium. Lucan,
v. 46, Consulite in modium patres. ovid, Met. i, has, In medium
quaerebant. Parry adds, virg. AEn. xi. 335, Consulite in medium.

18. Itaque postulo. Itaque = et ita. So Livy, v. 4, Ita geniti
itaque educati—Ni ipsa res monent, ‘⁶ But that occasion urges.”
Colman. In v. 20, “Audio’' is ironical. and equivalent to ‘⁴ non
credo? See Phorm. V. viii. 54, where, as here, “audio’' and “ fabu1ae”
areeggtele‘xeingsansvggrs to ῖιῐαῢοξηῗιᾶιε which he who utters them, doubts.

22. Sic hercle ut dic-mn tibi. ‘⁶ Ay, even, i'faith, as 1¹11 tell you.’' In
“ the next verse, ‘Bentley unnecessarily omits “ est.” Lindenbr. com·
pares Amphitr. 111. ii. 60—23 and Parry quotes Menander-'s line,

ὄργὴ φιλούντων ὀλίγον ἰσχύει χρόνον.

24. Id te ’oro »ut ante eamus. Donatus here supposed “ ob ’' to be
understood before id (as in Virg. AEn. ii. 141). But this is needless.
Id is the accusative of the thing after cro, and is explained by what
follows. “ Ι intreat thie of you, namely, that we anticipato them.”

25. Demque, &c. “ And while his passion is stopped by con·
tumelies.” Mil. G. 111.i. 11, Tuopte‘tibi consilio occludunt linguam.
In v. 26, Harwm scelera, “ the wiles of these creatures.’' Donatus
quotes a similar case of an invidious use of plural for singular. Eu. 1.
i. 3, Non perpeti meretricum contumelias. ’

29. consuetudine ct conjuyio liberali. 'I'his would seem to be a
Hendiadys for Consuetudine conjugii liberalis. (For instances of the ·
figure, Madvig. Gr. 481, and Virg. AEn. i. 61, 111.) construo “bound
by the intimacy arising fro-m honourable wedlock.” Liberalis, as Parry
observes, is opposed to “ peregrina'' (ΙΙΙ. i. 11).

30. Sese emersurum. A curicus case of “emergo,” used transitively.
Gronovius and Goveanus both quote Cicero Harusp. Respons. 25, Tum
'se emergit et fertur illuc.—Corn. Nepos. Atticus, VI, Quibus ex malis
ut se emersit. Apuleius in Apolog. V. xxxiii. 4: Gronovius.—Parry
instances a' similar transitive use of “ penetro.’' Menaeohm. IL iii. 54,
