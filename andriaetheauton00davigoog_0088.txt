Pamphilus. Do you mean to say you are not playing his game in this 1

He had said at 1. ii. 21, Siquis magistrum ceperit ad eam rem im-

probum. Parry inclines to this reading. Most editors to the former.
21. Quos mihi ludos redderet, ‘⁶ What a game he would have played

me.” This is the old and usual reading, which may be retained, as
analogous to the phrase “ Ludos praesenti hic seni Facere.” Mostell. ¹

Plaut. II. i. 80, and Mercator, II. i. 1, quoted by Parry. Bentley
affirming that “alicui ludos reddere ’⁹ is not Latin, proposed to read
“ Quos me ludos redderet,'’ ‘⁴ What a joke he’d have made of me,” which
Ruhnken approved and corroborated by reference to Plaut. Aulul. ΙΙ.
11. 75, Bacch. V. i. 4. There seems no occasion for the emendation.

22. Nunc hujus periculo, ἀφ, “ As it is, 'tis done at his peril, I'm all
right.” Nunc = as the matter stands. In portu navigo. Of. Virg.
AEn. vii. 598. Omnisque in limine portus. Plaut. Mero. IV. viii. 49,
Res est in portu. Parry compares cic. ad Fam. viii. 6. His tempesta·
tibus prope es solus in portu. · ·

ACTUS 111.—So. II.

. Ι
Lmsnu comes out to give some commands to Archillis, and lets the
audience know that Glycerium has a son. Simo is more fully persuaderi
of his idea that it’s all a hoax, and Davus chimes in with this view,
taking credit to himself for Pamphilus having withdrawn his affection
from Glycerium. Simo is determined to urge on the marriage.

M etre 2—1-4, Bacchiae Tetram.

Ι. 11. 33, Ea sunt ad virtutem omnia. Caesar de B. G. IV. iii. 101. Quae
sunt ad incendia. Lavet in v. 3, is i. q. lavetur3 the verb being used
in a middle sense—istaec, your mistress. Bentley read Fac istaec
lavet, or, fac ista ut lavet. The former is generally adopted. Post

subito.’' &c '

4. Dari-bibere. 'Phe old Latin writers preferred to say “dari bibere”
to “ dari potum ;'' the inf. to the supine. So Gronovius, who quotes Cato
de Re rustica, 104, Meridie dato bibere. Plaut. Pers. V. ii. 40, Bibere
da u ue plenis cantharis. Livy 40, 47, Ut bibere sibi juberet dari.
