mentions 8 reading “claudere'' for “claudicare,” hee. mancum esse,
“should be curtailed,” and observes that “ claudeo'’ and ‘⁴ claudo” were

cubi meam benignitatem sensisti in te claudier.

immediate celebration of the marriage. Simo states to Davus that he
has been outwitting him, for no marriage was intended z but that all is

goes home to prepare. Simo quite the stage to look for his son, and
Davus remains to soliloquise on his blunder.
