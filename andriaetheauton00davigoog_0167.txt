Fam. Lib. i. Ep. 5, Non facile possum existimare: and Ep. 7. Livy,
xliv 14,‘ ‘Inde existimari potest, qui habitus animorum audientibus ea
Patribus fuerit! '-—Om‘ne⁸ vos oratos vole, this is the· ‘orator' s’ 'proper
office3 see above at ver. 11, Oratorem esse voluit me, &c-

28. Crescendi θυρῶνι( ‘an opportunity of rising,” or “of advance-
ment.” cf. Hor. Od. Ι. xii. 45, Crescit occulto velut arbor oev0, διο.
Gove'anus quotes Cic. in Verrem, Act. ΙΙ. lib. v. c. 67st ‘Denique si videor
hic, quod ego non quaesivi, de uno isto voluisse mmm' ’δια

2⁹9. Novarwm. qui—sine vitiis, ‘⁴ to those who afford you the oppor-
tunity of witnessing new plays without faults.” “ Spectandi novarum ”
is an irregular construction for ‘⁴ spectandarum novarum.” We should
usually find the gerund with the cas'e the verb governs, or the
gerundive construction3 but in this ease we have a blending of both.
See Madvig, who, at sect. 413. obs. 2, quotes Cic. Phil. v. 3‚‘ ‘Facultas—
ayrm-am suis latronibus condonandi?² Parry adds Cic. in Verr. ΙΙ. ιι. 31.
Plaut. Captiv. 1v. ii. 7 2 There seems no more natural solution than-
that the writer blended two constructione, each common, in one,
in these instances, the infrequency of which strengthens this view.

30. Ne ille pro se, &e., ‘⁴1 say without faults, lest Lavinius (ille)
should dcem that Ι have spoken 1n his defence, who but lately (i. e., in
a recent comedy) made the people make way for a slave running in
the streetl' In this passage Perizonius, followed by Bentley, read

“dixisse'' for‘ ‘,”decesse which ιε explained of the impropriety pf· -the
people talking to a slave, which was beneath Roman dignity, though a
slave in a play might often address an “aside” to the people, his
audience. But there is no need to alter decm0(which'1s for‘ ‘decessisse' ')
for this' is a hit at Lavinius, who had introduced a slave thus running,
and the people making way for him, which breach of decorum that

“vetus poeta? excused, because the slave had a mad master. Com-
mentators compare with'“ servo currenti, ” Plaut. Amphitr. ῙΙΙ. iv. 33
Curcul. 11. iii. 1. And to these Parry adds, Stichus pII. Wh311i. Mer-

cator Ι. ii. 6: also from Plautus. —C'wr insano serviatst yshould ,

he be slave to a madmanss’ Parry. Others explain these wordysf ‘Why
should Terence plead for a foolP’ viz„ Lavinius. But this is not so
probable as the former interpretation.

35. Adeste aequo animo. cf. Andr. Prol. 24.

36. Statariam aqera‘ ‘to act a quiet play, ’' as opposed to the‘ ‘motoria
fabula‚’'‘ ‘the bustlmg play,” such as were the Eunuchus and Phormio,
and to the‘ ‘mixta,” which was a compound of both, e. g., the Andria
and Adel phi. So Parry explains, referring to Eun. ΡιοῙ. 44, and
Hecyra, ΡιοΙ. Ι. 4. and ΙΙ. 25, 34, for the force of per edentiwm. Rzoman
plays were interrupted by gladiatorial shows, and other popular amuse-
ments. Goveanus aptly quotes for the word‘ ‘stataria‚” a passage
from Cicero’ s Brutus, c. 30, where the word is transferred from acting
to oratory. See the passage at the close of the abovementioned
cha ter.

318). Sycophaatta. cf. Andr. IV. v. 20. —Clamore summo, &e., “Parte
ssat ask powers of voice and ιιοιι sides,’' Colman. -Mea cama: cf. below,

v. 23.

44. Se: quoe laboriosa est, “If any play is full of trouble and hard

work? “Siqua¹' and‘ ‘siquae’ ’appear to have been used indiscriminately ·

in the feminine singular, though with a slight preference for the former
