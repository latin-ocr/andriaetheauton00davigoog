ANDRIA. 65

Can counsel, and give comfort-thie? 1izhat grief
Which they themselves not feel : but tasting it,
Their counsel turns to passion, &q-

In tu si hic sis, “ hic ” seems to be best understood as said δεικτικῶς,
pointing to himself. Parry quotes Andr. V. iii. 19, Quasi tu hujus
indigeas patris.

11. onmia experiri,‘ ‘to leave no stone unturnedf' cf. Virg. AEn.
iv. 415, N equid inexpertum frustra moritura relinquat&

13. Credo impetrab0,‘ ‘1 shall gain, I trust! ’—wuth prodat dies,

“delay these nuptiale some few days? ” Prodere diem alicui rei, is,
according to Festus and Gronovius, rem in longius tempus differre.
So the Latius used producere diem, and so below, at verse 31, pvofme,

“aliquot dies profer?

14. Id ‘⁴ aliquid ’' nil est. With this catching up the words of
another, compare above act I. v. 92, Misera timeo ‘⁸ incertum '’ hoc
quorsum accidat. In the next verse, adeon? acl illwmf “ Shall 1 ap-
proach him 2” The present for the future tense. Compare Plaut.
Menoechm. 148 (Hildyard’s Glossary) ; Curcul. 378, Si reddo eis, quibus
debeo. Virg. AEn. ii. 322; Ter. Eun. IV. vii. 44. Bentley, instead of
Si nil impetres, read Nihil ut impetres, “though you should gain
nothing else by yourmove, you yain this, namely, that,” sce. But there
is no need of this alteration.

17. 'l'ranslate, ‘⁴ Go and be hanged with those suspicions of yours,
rascal. ¹ '’——abin', i. q. abisn02 an interrogative form used impr ecatprily.
-εοεῑω is for‘ ‘scelestusss' as “”arma for‘ ‘armati,” the thing for the
person. See Plaut. Rudens, ΙΙ. vi. 22; Ter. Andr. III. v. 1.

20. Neque auxili copiam. So Parry following the old read‘mgs,
except that they have auxilii, while he has auxili, with the penult
long by ictus. Bentley read neque ad auxilium copiam, following
Eugraphius.'1'his construction after copiam is not found elsewhere,
nor is there much ground for the change.

21. Sed istuc quid nam ’⁸22 “But what, pray, is this business of
yours1”—Aiunt,‘ ‘So ’tis saidl'

24. Ehodum dic mihist ‘Hark ye, tell me. ’' See above at Ι. 1. 2. For
numquidnam, see above, Andr. I. iv. 8. construe, ‘⁴ Have there been
any further love-passages between you and 1101·’1”

27. Principio . . . sed m: id non potest. Parry illustratos this by the .
Greek μάλιστα μὲν . . . εἰ δὲ nipe-Potest (fieri, sc.), a frequent ellipse.
See Plaut. Mil. Glor. III. i. 101, Tum pistricem 11011 potest quin
munerem, h. e., non potest fieri. Compare Menaechm. 340, Quantum
potest. With “profer,'’ in v. 29, compare above, v. 13, mvptiis prodat
{iesum-d seehHor. Od. L xv. 33, Iracunda diem proferet Ilio. In v. 28,

(τε is 1. q, ae.

31. oum is nil mereat. adponi ethin ‘When he deserves nothing,
to claim that to be laid to his account as kindnessf ’—Rcddidisti απίπιατη,

“’Ῡο11 ve revived me!

35. Id ayamff ‘I will do my utmost.'’ cf. below, ΙΙΙ. v. 8, Atque id
ago sedulo. In v. 36, optime is i. q. per- 0911011811οἉ ‘in the nick of ·
timel’

37. Nisi ea (μω nil opus sunt sciri. So Benthy, instead of“ scire.”
