solve the difficulty by a friend’s suggestion that conveni is i. q. venire
vidi. This is harsh beyond measure. Surely less inadmissible than
this is the supposition that ferre is the inf. for the participle present,
loosely used,serre for serentem—obolo, at a small cost. An obolus was
one—sixth of a drachm. So nummo is often used, e.g. Horat. Sat. ii. v.
109. N ummo addicere. Holera is another form of olera.

33. Ac nullm quddem. ‘⁴ N ay, not at all.'' Nullus for non. See
Catull. xvii. 20, Quam si nulla sit usquam3 viii. 14, Cum rogaberis
nulla. Eun. ΙΙ. i. 10 ; Hecyra, Ι. ii. 3, Nullus dixeris.

34. “ I suppose he's certainly not going to give her to our friend
here.''—Ridiculum caput, “ silly fellow,’' an instance of synecdoche,
with which compare Adelph. 11. iii. 8, Festivum caput. virg. AEn. iv.
354. Hor. Od. Ι. xxiv. 2. In Theocr. Idyll. vii. 38 στόμα is similarly
used.

36. vides, “look alive,’' “look out.’' Gronovius explains “ videre '⁶
here as “ providere, curare ea quae sunt necessaria.” See Heaut. IV. ii. 3,
Nisi aliquid video, ne esse amicam hanc gnati resciscat senex—A mbis,
“ canvass,’' use influence with. Properly to go round ns candidates.

PAMPHILUS is at a loss as to his father's reason for this pretence of
nuptials. Davus shows him that it is to get at the intentions of
Pamphilus, that he may have some one to blame, (which, till he knows
his son's mind, he has not,) for the refusal of Chremes to give his
daughter in marriage. Davus prevails on the young man to feign con·
sent and tell his father he will marry Philumena.

1—9. Trochaic Tetrameter Catalectic.
10-19. Iambic Trimeter.
20—29. Iambic Tetrameter.

2. si id succenseat. 152, accusative· of limitation. succenseat, “should
entertain a secret grudge,''literally ‘⁴ should take a private account,n Smith
L. D. As Parry observes, the order here is somewhat involved.
Translate, “ It· he should now owe a grudge on this account <namely,
that Chremes does not give you his dauqhter to wife) prior to having 2
ascertained the feelings of your mind in reference to the marriage, he
would seem even to himself, and justly too, to be in the wrong.”-
Priusquam perspexerit is to be referred to “ succenseat.”—Ibi = there-
upgn.m illae twrboe fient. “ 'I'hen will those terrible rows take plaoe.·’
In the 5th verse noym-is ducere, i. q. negaris te ducturum. Cf. Heaut.
111. i. 78, Dare denegaris—Quidvis patiar, “1 will endure anything
whatever.'' This is a much better reading than Quid vis, patiar? h. e.
ut patiar.

7. Dictum ac factum, ‘⁸ no sooner said than done.'’ Compare
Heaut. V. i. 31, Dictum factum. Ruhnken quotes, ἅμα ἔπος, ἅμα ἔργον,
and 11. xix. 212, αὐτὶκ’ ἔπειθ’ ἅμα μῦθος ἔην, τετέλεστο δὲ ἔργον.
