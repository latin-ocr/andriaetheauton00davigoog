- 1. Ubi illic eet scelus, qui me perdidit? Bentley proposed a note of
interrogation at eet, and the omission of perdidit as well as “ mihi? at
the end of the line. Parry defends the old reading, which, by his aid,
is quite satisfactory. Illic scelus, qui, the maso. pronouns agreeing
with neut. noun, or rather with the masc. object for which that neut.
noun stands, is a not uncommon case of the figure Synesis, or Schema

quae generosius Perire quaerens——where “ quae'’ agrees with “ Cleopatra,”
implied in “monstrum.”) See Eun. ΙΙ. iii. 10, Senium qui me hodie
remoratus est. Parry quotes Anacreon, iii. 17, βρέφος· φέροντα τόξον.
The difficulties of scansion Mr. Parry solves by showing that ·‘ ubi'· is
pronounced as “ οὺ,” and eo elided, while iccio and scelus are pro-
nounced as monosyllables. Illic is i. q. ille. ⁸

2. Nulli aemili. Nulli, the old genitive for nullius. Plaut. Mil. G.
ΙΙΙ. i. 207, has, Studiosus nullae rei aliae, where “ nullae '' is for “nul-
lius.’'

7. In v. 3, futili is literally “leaky.” A “ vas'' was called “ futile?

Hessffussec quid me nuuc faciam ecia—See IV. ii. 26. Quid me fiet 3
Me = de me. Gronov. (Livy, xxiii. 16), says that three forms were in
use, “ Quid me faciam :'' “quid de me faciam θ’ “ quid mihi faciam? Δ tque
id ayo εεάαῐο, “And yet that's what 1 am busy about.” In v. 9, mov-mm
is the cognate accusative after productam, which would of itself signify
‘⁴ to cause delays.'’ Producam is the more common reading. Hm

11. Miserum impeditum esee! Note here the force of ·‘ impedio,” to
put your foot into a Μαι-ος “ expedio,” to get it out again. The slang
phrase“ to put your foot into it‚” may have arisen, like many others, from
this classical origin. For the metaph. see Plaut. Mil. G. IV. ix. 11,
Sese jam impedivit in plagas: quoted by Parry. And see also Plaut.
