3. venit mditatvts, διο. “ He comes, with his part learnt, from some
lone spot.” meditor, μελετσῷ, to rehearse. cf Virg. Ecl. i. 2. Pari-y
quotes Plaut. Trinumm. ΙΙΙ. iii. 87—-90, In act V. iv. 6, we have in the
same sense “ venit paratus? Alio-unde ex solo loco, h. e. ex aliquo solo
loco; the adverb from a place being equivalent to the ablative with ex.
Ruhnken quotes Plaut. Aul. IV. vi. 7, Cogito solum locum. In verse 4,
⁶· sperat ”is little more than “ putat.” Cf. Virg. AEn. i. 543.

5. Qui differat te. “ Whereby he may disconcert you.” Adelph.
ΙΙΙ. iv. 40, Differor doloribus. Plaut. Pseud. Ι. iii. 125. Fac apud te
ut sies, “ 'Pake care to be sslf-possest.” Cf. below, V. iv. 34, vix sum
apud me. Modo ut possim is i. q. si modo possim.

7. Commutatwmm esse unum verbum, “ bandy one word.” Phorm.
IV. iii. 32, Tria non commutabitis Verba hodie inter vos. It may how-
ever simply mean ‘⁴ collocuturum esse‚’' and this sense of “ commuto,'‘
says Gronovius, Gellius illustratos from Claudius Quadrigarius (xvii. 2),
“ Putabam: eos qui in arce erant, inter se commutationes et consilia
facere ;” where he explains “ commutationes '’ as “communicationes'’

AOTUS IL—Sc. V.

Byrrhia having been ordered by Charinus to keep an eye on Pam-
philus, and to find out his pians, overhears him promising his father
that' he will marry Philumena.

Metre z—Iambic trimeter&

¹2. Bentley read Hodie observarem, quid, and bracketed v. 3 as
spurious, because “hunc ’' would refer to Pamphilus, who had been on
the stage before, and could not be said to be “ venientem.” But this is
quite unnecessary. Hunc refers to Simo. “ Observare, ut scirem quid
ageret ” is the construction—Relictis rebus in v. 1 means “ neglecting my
business.” See Eun. Ι. ii. 863 Lucret. iii. 1084.—ld propterea in v. 3
is a curious pleonasm. Propterea = propter eam rem3 and we shoqu
expect “id propter’:‚or “ propterca? In act iii. sc. v. we have “ ea res
ωιόῗῖἓῗνῗῗοξυὲῗοῗῖ Ho there, look out !'' Observa quae tibi mandavi,
ut apud te sis. Ruhnken. See Adelph. 11. i. 18. .

7. Probe: “ Well done !’' an exclamation of approval of Pamphilus's
feigned surprise. Phorm. II. i. 29, 0 artificem probum—Hodie . . . volo.
“ 1²11 have you marry to-day, as Ι said.” Volo and nolo are words of
imlperiousness, as Donatus shows, comparing Adelph. ΙΙΙ. iii. 25, Prius
no o.

9. Neque istic . . . mora. “Neither in that command of yours, nor
in aught else, shall you anywise find disobedience (opposition) on my
part.’' This use of usquam is rare. With this-phrase compare Virg.
Ecl. iii. 52, In me mora non erit ulla.

11. Cum qratia. “ Cheerfully,” “ willingly.’' Compare Phor-m.
IV. iii. 17, Cum bona gratis. In v. 12, uxore excidit “ has missod a wife.”
Gr. ἐξέπεσε. Ruhnken quotes Livy Epit. 29, Regno excidit Massinissa.
-Ne in mord . . . sies, a variation of the construction in v. 9.
