Ι 162 Norae on

84, Magis procax factast ilico. ——Nobt'lie here means “notoriousss’ for
which sense Parry quotes Rudens (Plaut.) ΙΙΙ. 11. 5, Scelere fieri nolunt
nobiles. It seems to mean‘ ‘common‚ '’“ known” in a bad sense.

16. Tum quodeidem, recte eet, “Then as to what 1 may ygive her,
that’s all right? i. e. “I ⁸have nothing: ’⁸ “Recte est” ‘is used, says
Gronovius. for “non est,'' “nil est.” We sometimes use “all right '⁰ in
the same ironical sense. Gronovius quotes Eun. II. iii. 50, and Heaut.
111. ii. 7, Quid tu istic? Recte. Adel ph. 1. v. 19. —Nwm niz esee, &e.,

“For 1 have scruples about saying ‘I have nothing! ’⁹' Compare Andr.
V. iv. 88, for alipio.- and ibid. IV. iii. 15, note.

Ac'ms 11.-813. 11.

Cuma 18 introduced as being anxious about the good faith of his
mistress Antiphila, who is long in coming, and who, he thinks, must
have been estranged0from him while he was abroad. Clitipho comforts
him, at the same time advising him not to let himself be seen.

Metro. · Iambic Tetrameter.

2. Verum (8ο. Mulier et servus.) Gom-amma nudeoe opiniones—
animum, 810. We retain, with the older editors, and with Parry, the
common reading, which Bentley had altered without valid reason into

“Concurrunt multa eam opinionem quae mihi animo exaugeant.”
He objected to the received reading that‘ ‘exaugere animum’ ’could
only apply to‘ ‘joy, ” and that“ opiniones” would be a word inapplicable
here. But we may safely translate,‘ ‘Many grounds occur to me
simultaneously to increase this feeling. '’ Parry quotes a parallel from
Euripid. Med. 284, ξυμβάλλεται δε πολλὰ τοῦδε δείματος.

4. Mater—mala. cf. Juvenal. vi 240, Scilicet expectes ut tradat
mater honestos Aut 81108 mores, quam quos habet, dcc. -ῼιιοίω, Quoi
= “cujusl’ “cui”

6. Etiam caveas ‘Are you even yet careful?” h. e. “Are you careful
enoug Μ’· or “Be very careful.” Compare Andr. V. 11. 8, Etiam tu
hoc rispondes. Adelph. IV. ii. 11, Etiam taees‘l Parry 8(1(18 Trinumm.
Plaut. II. iv. 113. For “hinc ’³ Bentley reads “ hic‚'’ because “a patre '’
refers to Clinia’s father, Menedemus. For “a patre,” see Andr. 1.
111. 21.

7. Qum-premyss mali. Praesagire = acute sentire, Festus.
Gronovius quotes Plaut. Aulul. 11. 11. 1, Prasagibat mi 8111111118, διο.
Where see Hild y’ard s note. From“ sagire' are derived“ saga’ ’and

“.sagax '' See 81ζο Cic. de Div. 1. 31.

9. Quando istuc ‘jam' wit. Fleckeisen introduces ‘⁴ jam” into the
text here, and this may be defended by reference to several
in the Andria, when some one word 18 caught up out of the speaker's
mouth.

10. Non cogitem, hinc lmnqule ase! “Don’t you take into account,
that ’tis some little distance hence;” i. e., Antiphila’s dwelling.
