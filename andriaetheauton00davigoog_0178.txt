boni, boni quid porto. Heaut. III. i. 49, Pytissando modo mihi,

Quid vini absumpsit.-Quid vini, “ What a quantity of wine 1 '' See

also Plaut. Epid. II. ii. 26, Tum captivorum quid ducunt secum ί

i—Et macic, et mm noverunt, διο. Two more reasons why they are
ate. “ “ “

um a me l

11. Quam ⁶9⁰ cum wnd ancillula, διο. Parry places a full stop at
‘⁸ reliqui ;'' in which case we must- take the words to be an exclamation
of surprise; or govern “ quam” by ‘⁶ viden.'' If we merely have a
comma at “ reliqui‚'’ and read “ unde ei esse censes3” the construc-
tion will be simplet, and this is the reading in many MSS„ ‘⁸ Whence
think you has she, whom I left here with but one handmaid, all these
things 2”—Qaid turbae cst, “What a crowd it is !”-AEde3 nostrae! “Our
house !” i. e. my master’s ; an idiom of all servant-language.—Vix
capient, ‘⁸ Will scarce hold them.’'

16. Interea loci, “ In the mean time.” See Madvig. Gr. sect. 284,
obs. 10. Plaut. Menaech. 351, Hildyard’s Glossary. Ter. Eun. 11. ii.
24, Dum loquimur; interea loci ad macellum advenimus—errante, “ a
vagrant.” It must be borne in mind that these exclamatione of Clinia
arise from his referring what Syrus and Dromo say to Antiphila, who
alone is expected by the young men. ‘⁴

19. Mores cwntabat mihi, “ Was ever forewarning me of the ways of
these women.’' For this use of “canto‚'' see Plaut. Trinumm. 11. ii. 19,
Hoc tibi quotidie canto, ut caveas. Mostell. IV. ii. 64. Terence in
Phorm. 111. ii. 10, has, Eandem cantilenam canere.—Mmmisse snutra,
seems to convey the ground of Clinia's shame in regat-d to his father,
and to be governed by “illum'' understood. construe, “ As to whom
I’m now ashamed and regretful, for he was ever forewarning me of the
· ways of such creat-ures as this, that he admonished me in vain.”

21. Tam, quom yratum mihi esse potuit, nolui, “When it might have
gained me thanks‚ then 1 would not do it !'' For this use of matum,
compare Eun. 111. i. 6, Est istuc datum Profecto ut grata mihi sint,
quae facio omnia. Cic. Phil. ΙΙ. xlvi. 117, Quam sit pulchrum, bene-
ficio gratum, δυο. See also ,“ingratum,” Heaut. V. i. 61.—- Videlicet,
“It’s very clear.” cf. scilicet, ilicet—Picum amorem, in v. 23, is “the
object of your love.” See Eun. V. iv. 4, Amorem difficillumum.
Ovid. Met. 1. 452, Primus amor Phoebi Daphne.

25. Oonjectwam cepimus, is here the usual reading. Goveanus and
Bentley, following the Bembine MS„ read ‘⁶ fecimus.”

28-9. anu-3, Quoe est dicta mater, ἀο. Compare above at 11. ii. 4.
Obiit mortem. See Andr. Ι. iii. 18, note.—Alterae, in v. 30, is for
“ alteri ;” an archaism for which compare Eun. V. vi. 3, Solae. Phorm.
V. viii. 35, Repudium alterae remiserim. Plaut. Mil. Glor. 11. iv. 3,
Mihi solae e quo superfit. Lucret. IL 7 7 8. ,

32. Mam, doc. Cf. Andr. IV. i. 34. Syrus knows that if he begins a
digression to explain who “ altera” is, it will cause endless confusion ;
so he puts that off, till he has told Clinia all about Antiphila.

33. Jam primurm. omnium, a pompous beginning. Commentators
remark that with these words Livy begins his history.

36. ommno hic se conjecit intro. “ For-thwith Dromo here flung him-
self in (to surprise Antiphila).” Gronovius illustratos this phrase by
