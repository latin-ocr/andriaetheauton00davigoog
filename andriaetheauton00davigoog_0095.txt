16. Sim—ad me redeam. “ Let me recover myself,” (“ ut” under·
stood.) Compare Adelphi, V. iii. 8, Tandem reprime iracundiam, atque
ad te redi—Iam aliquid dispiciam ,· “1 shall soon hit upon something :''
h.e. discover by mental process. . .

18. Bentley reads “ monet” for “ sinit.” But there is no need of
this. As Parry well observes, “a verb may be used in its natural
sense in one clause, and in a derived sense in another.’' In the first
clause we must supply “ monet '⁸ in sense ε consti-ning, “=Present time
compels me to look out for myself, and does not let me take vengeance
on γοιι.π Ruhnken quotes Catull. lxv. 102, “Aut mortem oppeteret
Theseus, aut praemia laudis,'' where another verb must be supplied in

sense in the 2nd clause.

he will yet find means to hinder the nuptiale.
