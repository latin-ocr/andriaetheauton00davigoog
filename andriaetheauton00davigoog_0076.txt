1-5, 8—9. Iambic Tetrameters, with a clausula.
6-7, 10-16, 19-25, Trochaic Tetrameters.
17-18, 26—35, 64—65. Iambic Tetrameters.

36—63. Iambic Trimeters.

1. Humanum factu aiot inceptu? The supines in u, after a noun
adjective. This is Bentley's reading. Parry, following Zeune, reads
factum aut vhzceptmm. In the next line we follow Bentley, “quid 'st si
hoc non contumeliast.'’ Others read, “ si non haec contumelia ’st.”

3. Uxorem decrerat. Ruhnken supposes an ellipse of “si ’' as in
AEn. vi. 31, Partem opere in tanto, sineret dolor, Icare, haberes. Par-ry
suggests that the pluperfect here throws back the events alluded to, so
as to allow Pamphilus’s present trouble to stand out.

4. Nonne communicatum oportuit? (ab illo fuisse understood.) Cf.
Heaut. I. ii. 26, ‘⁶ Ought Ι not to have been earlier apprised of this.”

6. Quid Chremes, “ What's this of Chremes.” In ver. 7, Id mutavit,
Bentley preferred to read, “ Is mutavit,’¹ making the verb absolute.

But the other reading is preferable.
10. adeone hominem. esse invenustum, “ 'I'o think that a man could be

so unfortunate in love ’' (invenustum, from in, and Venus), “or luckless
as I am !” This is a case of the acc. with infin. without a governing
proposition, in order to denote complaint or surprise. See Madvig.
Gr. ξ 399 ; Wordsworth, Gr. of King Edward VI. 5 135, obs.; Virg.
AEn. i. 37 3 Ter. Andr. V. ii. 293 IV. ii. 6. Gronovius refers invenustus

to tbe lucky throw of the dice, called Venus, quoting Propertius IV.

ix. 19—20; Horace, Ode ΙΙ. vii. 25.

13. Contemptus, spretus. These refer, of course, to Pamphilus.—
Repudietue repetor, “After being rejected, Ι ’m 1·ecalled.”-—Ni8i si, i. q.
illisi. Compare Adelphi lV. iii. 3, Nisi si me in illo credidisti numero

ominum esse. ·

15. Aliquid monstri alunt. A more offensive expression, according
to Donatus, than aliquod monstrum, “ They are nursing up some
wretched creature, and since she cannot be thrust upon any one else,

they have recourse to me.''
18. Nam quid, &a “ What in the world now shall Ι say of my fatherff

—Nam is used emphatically. See Aulul. Plaut. I. i. 3„ Nam cur me ver·
beras3 Cure. 398; Menaechm. Plaut. Hildyard’s Glossary, 150, who
quotes St. Luke xxiii. 22, τί ’γὰρ κακὸν ἑποιήσεν, “ Why what evil heth
he done2 ''--Tantamne rem, διο. See above, v. 10.

21. obstipui3 an old reading for obstupui—obstipam is, according to
Smith, derived from obstipus, “ bent to one side,'' th. stipes. In the
next line causam depends on proloqui, “ or any excuse, however ill·
suited, false, or unreasonable.’'

23. Quod ei eyo rescissem id 'prius quid facerent, siquis me royet, “ But
should any one ask me, what Ι would have done, had Ι come to know
this before.” Facerem = fecissem, as in Sallust, B. J. 59, quoted by

Ruhnken and Gronovius. Bentley read

‘⁶ QUOdteffi oggi· ,scissem id prius, quid facerem, siquis nunc me in-
