ACTUS IV.—so. 1.

Sos'rnau, wife of Chremes, enters in great excitament at having

she hed disobeyed his orders when it was exposed, and had given the
old Corinthian woman to whom the babe had been consigned, to be
made away with, a ring to place with it. This ring she has found in
possession of Antiphila. Chremes after awhile forgiven her, and goes
with her to see his new found daughter.
