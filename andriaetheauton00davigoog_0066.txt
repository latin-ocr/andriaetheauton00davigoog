Menaechl 80). In confirmation of v. 10, Donatus states that the first
scene of0Menander's Perinthian is almost verbatim that of his Andria.
Terence in this and the following lines vindicatos his right of availing
himself od whatever suits his play in the two Greek ones above·
mentione .

12. Non ita dissimili δια, “ not very unlike.’' For this peculiar use
οἳ “non ita” see Hor. Sat. ΙΙ. vi. 1, “Modus agri non ita magnus ; ’⁹
Livy iv. 12, “ Haud ita multum frumenti.” Parry ably shows that the
metre of this verse will stand if we pronounce ammento as a bri-
syllable‚ justifying the elision of a long ‘vowel by “ pulmentum,
q⁰²1⁹45³⁰3a55 ffiffi'rffi23322321⁶234331⁶ffin⁸ffl3233ffi'ffl ι· 1210--
at the end of this verse, needlessly. Understaud poeta from v. 1.

15. in eo disputant. According to Gronovius, in his Excerpta
Terentiana, “ disputare in aliqua re,” is i. q. ‘⁴ sermonibus aliquam rem
jactare et infamare‚” to carp and cavil at anything. Translate, “ They
eat-pingly maintain this, that plays ought not to be blended.” For
contamino in the same sense, see Ter. Heaut. Pr. 17; Eunuch. 111. v. 4.
Contamino (th. tango) is not necessarily used in a bad sense.

17. πω ὄηιεῑίἰρεπῶο., This nae, often written ·ne in MSS„ is ·--·- to
nimis', multum, διο.. according to Donatus. Bentley supposed an iuter-
rogation at the close of the line, and explained “ faciunt ne '’ to mean
‘⁶ Don't they bring about '2⁹’ But this is very unsatisfactory. Ruhnken
quotes a line of Menander:

φρονεῖν uara-tw ἐστὶ καὶ οὐδὲν φρονεῖν.

Translate the two next verses, “ For in accusing him, they accuse our
author's models, Naevius,¹’ duc. And for this sense of auctores, see Hor.
Sat. Ι. iv. 122. Bitschel, in an essay, De AEtate Plauti, the gist of
which is analysed in Smith’s Dict. of G. and R. R. ΙΙΙ. 407, B.. shows
. that the chronological order of names here given is right. Plautus was
somewhat older than Ennius, and Naevius than Plautus.

24. Favete, “ keep silence,” εὐφημεῖτε. Compare Hor. Od. ΙΙΙ. i. 2,-
“ Favete linguis,’' and Virg. AEn. v. 71, “ Ore favete omnes.” “ Adeste
aequo animo,'’ is “ be candid umpires,’' the duty of whom was “ rem
cognoscere,” to take cognisance of the matter, with a view, “ ut pernos-
catis,” to arrive at a sound decision. Parry rightly shows that reliquum
is the adjective (and not the adverb as τὸ λοιπὸν, οι· the genitive plural
for reliquarum, as co'mmentators had dreamed) by quoting Eunuoh
11. ii. 9, “ Ut spes nulla reliqua in te esset tibi.’' . ' Α

26. With ‘⁴ de integro '’ compare the Greek use of ἐξ ὑστέρης ; ἐκ νέης,
iu like sense in Herodotus—exiyendoe, “to be hissed offi”-1m'm . . ,
sc. “ quam spectentur? Compare Hecyr. Prol. Alt. 5, “ Partim sum
earum exactus, partim vix steti.” So ⁴iss used also ⁸‘ explodo.’'
