T welfth Night, and the Duke’s speech to Valentino, touching Olivia’s
grief for her brother's death, “ Ο she that bath a heart,” &c-

87. Quid multis moror (te verbis, sc.‚) a kindred phrase to Paucis te
volo: another form is, Quid multa. In ver. 89, etiam = still, or as
yet. Ruhnken quotes Andr. III. ii 23, and Virg. AEn. vi. 485, Etiam
currus etiam arma tenentem.

90. Effer-tum: ὁπως. For a criticism of ancient date on this passage,
see Cicero de Oratore, ii. 80. Effertwt· (ἑκφὲρεται) and mm, are “ voces
solennes,'’ in reference to funerals. For the former, comp. Hor. Sat.
11. v. 85, Anus improbaThebis Ex testamento sic est elata 3 and Livy,
i. 59. Effertw· might be said with special propriety of an Athenian
funeral, which, by Solon's law, was extra-mural.

92. Roman. So. Βοπᾶ fortasse, Bentley proposed, “ Forma bona.
So. Fortasse;” so making the complimentary adjective issue from
Simo’s mouth, and the cold “ fortasse '’ (oh, no doubt 1), from Sosia.
But the general reading is satisfactory. Forma is the shape and
general bearing (th. fero).-voltm, the countenance or expression
(perhaps from vol, root of volo, Smith).—pedisequas below, is “lowest

. female slaves.” In v. 94, we read qwae quom with Bentley. The usual

reading is quia tum.

’ 98. Percussis ilico oenimum, ‘⁴ It struck me on the spot.” Gronov.
interprete, percutere animum, in suspicionem venire, quoting Cic.
de Or. ii. 87. Utendum est imaginibus acribus insignitis, quae celeriter
percutere animum possint; and Ep. ad Att. l. iv. Ep.— 8. Ι Atat, “ Ho Ξ
ho i '' an expression of light just dawning on a subject. Comp.
Aulul. Plaut. III. i. 8.-Ilico = in loca—Hinc illae lacrumae, passed
from Terence into a proverb3 for which see Hor. Epist. Ι. xix. 41,
Cicero pro Cael. 25, Juvenal i. 168.

101. Ad sepvdmm vestinum, h. e. to the funeral pile. Ruhnken shows
that sepelire (the root of sepulcrum), applied to burning the body
equally with other forms of burial. In 102, most editions have “ In
ignem plositad est.'' Bentley and Lindenbrog, imposita est, which we
have fo owe .

104. I ln· tvm, “ thereupon‚” an expression like jam nunc, itaque
ergo, &c With “imprudentius ’' (too rashly) in ver. 103, cf. Liberius in
v. 24.

106. mediam mulierem complectitur. Compare Aristoph. Achai-n.
272—5, ὡρικὴν ὑληφόρον - μέσην λάβονι·’ ἄραντα, nestun. In v. 109.
Quam strengthens the positive adverb familiariter, “Oh, how familiarly.”
—Oernere3‚ one might discern. ,

111. Nec satis ad objwyandwn camoe (erat, sc), “ And yet 1 had no
ἱ sufficient grou'nd‚'' διο. Donatus compares Virg. AEn. ii. 314, Nec sat
rationis in armis. In v. 113, quae = quum illa. ·

114. Honesta oratio ἐι, “ The plea 's fair enough.'' Colman translates
the next two verses,

“ For him, who saved a life, if ¹you reprom,
What would you do to one who offers wrong 3 ’⁸

The difference of mood in molit and dederit is explained by the former
stating axfact, the latter a supposed case—Damnum = hurt to property 3
malum, to person. The former is derived from dap (δαπάνη).

119. Ρετερνίπατη, a term of contempt : “ Meretricem :” Goveanus.
