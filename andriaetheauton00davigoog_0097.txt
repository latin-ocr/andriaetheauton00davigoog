ANDRIA. '83

It is properly ana originally “aminis loqur· without any idea of
guaz-gel. So Ruhnken on this passage, who quotes Caesar de Bell. Civ.
m. .

31. Imo etiam, quo, διο. “ Nay rather, so little do you know my
troubles.”-Quo minus, separated by Tmesia—Nunc, ‘⁴ but now,’' “just
lately.” Pa coactus tud voluntate ee. Homer 11. iv. 43, ἑκὼν &butoni
γε θυμῷ. Aristoph. ἑκὼν οὐχ {teda—Mane, “ Hold there !'' Heaut.
11. iii. 32.

36. Qum· (cur) me enicas? “Why do you worry me to death :²⁹⁹
Compare Eun. ΙΙΙ. v. 6, Rogitando obtundat, enicet. Compare also the
use of exanimo, in Hor. od. ΙΙ, xvii. 1, Our me querelis exanimas
tuis. In v. 37, “esse’' is omitted after “me'' by Bentley. It is not
needful to the metre. See Parry's Introduction. ‚p. li., note 8.

39. Qm’s homo istuc, διο. In this verse Bentley omits “ interturbat T’
as a gloss which had crept into the text. Parry retains it because
Donatus specially notices the word. Goveanus and others read,

0· Quis hoc istuc? P. Davos. O. Davos? P. Davos omnia.
And Goveanus gives “interturbat'’ there as a gloss. But there seems
no sound reason for departing from the text, as Donatus read it.
Construe ‘⁸ 0. What man 2—P. Davum—0. What, Davus 2—P. Causea
'all this confusion—0. Wherefore Ἱ-Ρ, Ι know not, save that I’m very
sure the Gods were wroth with me for listening to him.'’ Qui
signifying the cause, takes a subjunctive. —Deoa fuisse iratos. See
Phorm.‚ 1. ii. 24, IV, iii. 31. Hor. Sat. II. iii. 8, Iratis natus paries
dis atque poetis. ,

42. Duimt, the old form for “dent’' See Plaut. Menaechm. 184
(Hildyard), where “ dujff’ occurs.—Aulul. 23, Duit. So in Ter. ’
Phorm. V. viii. 4, we have creduas for credas3 and in Menaechm. 223,
perduint for perdant. “‘At,” in the beginning of this verse, betokens
a burst of indignation. Compare Virg. ii. 535, At tibi pro scelere
exclamat, pro talibus ausis. Ovid. Heroid. xii. 1, At tibi Colchorum,

διο. Hor. Epod. v. i, At o Deorum siquis in caelo regis, διο. Parry .

quotes several passages where “ at'' introduces favourable prayers.

44. Quod nisi Ιιοσ. Bentley reads quidni Ῑιοσ. In v. 45, Scio is
“no doubt'’ ironicallyz ¹

46. Hac non successit (quod ago: scilicet). “Our plan has not suc-
ceeded this way3 we will make the attempt another way.” Probably
successit is used impersonally3 as processit below, at v. 47.

49. Imo etiam, “ Nay, on the contrary ε for l'm very sure, if you look

vigilare aequum est. Ad streiigthens the force of viyilo. Noatgl the use
of unus in the plural, because used with a substantive which has nu
singular. See Madvig. 76, c. obs.

51. Pro ammio, “in consideration of my being your slave,” “aa a
slave’s duty,” “ as befits your slave.’' Parry quotes Adelph. 1. i. 23,
Pro mem—Manibus pedibm3 see above, I. i. 134.

54. Westerhov. compares Menander in Δεισιδαίμονι, quoted by
Stobaeus :—

ὅταν οὗ πονηρῶς, ἀλλὰ μετ’ εὐνοίας τινός ,
