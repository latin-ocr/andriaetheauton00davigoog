Acrns L—so. 11.

vSIMO in this scene questions Davus respecting his son’s amour, and
tries by prayers and threats, to recal him from his scheme of breaking
off the marriage. ‘

Matres of this scene :—
1—4, 25—27. Iambic Trimeters.
5. Iambic Dimeter.
6, 9—-24, 28—34. lambio Tetrameters.
7 -8. Trochaic Tetrameters catalectic.

1. Nozit here either governs an accusative, as in such cases as Ecl.
ii. 58, or requires “ ducere ’' understood—Foras, “forth,” acc. of
motion, froin foris. “

4. Mirabar Ιιοο οἱ sic abiret. “ I was marvelling if this would end
here.’' Gronovius, for this use of abeo quotes Catull. xiv. 16, Non
hoc, non tibi, salse, sic abibit. Auctor ad Herenn. iv. 52, Cum illum
mihi datis ac vos auribus meis opplorare non desinitis? Non abibit.
In what follows, take semper with verebar. The explanation of
semper lenitas (as in Κάδμου τοῦ πάλαι, Soph. OEd. T. 1), is very
problematical.——With quorsum evaderet, compare Ι. i. 100, above. Eri is
i. . heri.

q'l. Qum‘quam, h. e., cuiquam3 see above, Ι. i. 21, quor for cur.

9—10. “This was his design, that, we, being so entirely without
suspicion, should be led on by falsely-grounded joy, and indulging
hope, when at last our fear was removed, should meanwhile be sur·
prised off our gua d.” Daci seems equivalent to produci. —oscitari
(os ciere), Gr. χασ σθαι, is, properly, to gape or yawn. See Hildyard’s
Gloss. on Plaut. Menaechm. 732.

13. Hem This interjection denotes here the gesture of surprise
which Davus assumes. Herm? est, &a was an asida-ehodum may be
οὓῗ41ῗὸἳῗίᾶρῖἕξέτὲὥέῗνίἕῖἲωῖξσξὶ,ιὶ“2ὀὴ, to be sure, the world cares much
for that.” Scilicet is used ironically. So Vir. AEn. iv. 379, Scilicet is
superis labor est Ξ ea cura quietos Sollicitat.

15. Hoccine aqi-3, am} non? “ Are you minding me or not 2 ’⁸ Gronov.
says this phrase arose from the sacred rites‚ wherein a herald, to call
attention, used to cry, τοῦτο πράξατε, hoc agite. Compare Plaut.
Menaechm. 726 (Hildyard), Hanc rem age. Ter. Heaut. IV. i. 16,
Loquere: audio. S. At jam hoc non ages. C. Agam.—Davus replies,
Ego vero (ago) istuc, “Well, Ι am heeding you.'' Istuc, it must be
remembered, is the pronoun demonstrative of the second person.

17. Tempus . . . tulit. Compare Ter. Adelph. I. i. 28, Quae fert
adolescentia, Heaut. II. i. 3.--Α nimum ut expleret, “to follow his incli-
nations.” Comp. Andr. IV. i. 16, animo morem gessero. Adelph.
1. i: 8, Atque animo obsequi. In v. 18, Bentley reads “defert'' Others
“affert”

20. Hoc quid eit! (miror, 80), “ What can this mean'l'’—Ita aiunt,
‘⁶ 'Tis said s0,” an unwilling assent. See Heauton. Ι. ii. 37, Ita credo.
Tum siquis . . . applicat, “ And if a man take an evil counsellor on such
matters, that person mostly influences for evil a mind in ³tself dis·
