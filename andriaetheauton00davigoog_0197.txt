I ’11 soon rouse them.” Compare Andr. V. ii. 23, and note there.—
Mca Phryyia. Names of attendants were commonly derived from the
countries whence they were bought, e. g.‚ Andria, Lesbia, Samia.

11. Ouo-riculo permeare, “Run across in a jiffey.” Curriculo isthus ·
adverbially used at Plaut. Pers. ΙΙ. ii. 17, Vola muricula Mil. Glor.
11. vi. 43, Transcurrito ad vos rursum curriculo: and elsewhere.—
Ayitat, ‘⁸ is celebrating.” So Hecyr. I. ii. 18, Agitarem apud vos libere
convivium. Ov. vii. 431, Agitant convivia patres—Adservari, ‘⁴ that
I am detained ltere? Andr. V. ii. 24, Cura adservandum vinctum.

13. Verba me his datwmm, ‘⁶ that I will deceive them.’' See note at
Andr. L iii. 6. Menaech. 55 (Hildyard)‚ ‹tc—Quin ⁶9⁰ maneo. This
mocking repetition of quin is ironical. Syrus says, “Well, but the
money’s all ready.’' Bacchis rejoins, “ Well, but 1 ’m not going away.”
-Nwm ⁶90 imm? “Do I prees for it;”-At κάπ’ quid, sodes! “But
d'ye know what, pray ’Ξ ” sc. facias.

18. Tua pompa eo traduoendmt. This is properly said of sacrificial
processions3 as Gronovius shows in a learned note on this passage.
Plaut. M. G. 1. i. 67, “ Quae me ambae obsecraverint, Ut te hodie quasi
pompam illas praeterducerem.” Ovid. A. A. i. 147, At cum pompa
frequens caelestibus ibit Eburnis. Hence it came to be used of any
train, or retinue, e. g.‚ ‘in Bacchid. Ῑ. ii. 6, “ Quo nunc‘capessis te hinc
adversa via, cum tanta¹ pompa.”— Quam rem ayis, soclus. cf. Heaut.
Ι. i. 37.—E9on'? Arymtwm. cudo, &c., “ What 1, coining money, to give
you.’'

19. Βίρηαπι me putas, quam inludo-3? In Andr. IV. iv. 19, we have
“in quibus sic illudatis; ” and more usually, as in Eun. V. iv. 20, “in

quos-'⁹ See also Andr. V. i. 3.—Non est temere (hoc factum, sc.), “ ’Τίς
no reckless act.” ‘⁸ I ’m in earnest.”

20. Etiamne tecum hic mihi res est? “ Am Ι still to deal with you in
this matter. Hic = in hac re. For etiam, equivalent to etiam nunc,
see Andr. Ι. i. 89. Syrus replies Minime· .· vuum tibi reddo, ‘⁸ By no
means. I ’m going to give you your own,'’ i. e., what 1 promised you.
Cf. Adelph. ΙΙ. ii. 41, Meum mihi reddatw.-Eam (a me: sc.). ’

25 Hocpaulmm mori q‘eoemtwn cidamni adportet, “ How much loss this
slight gain brings him.'' Compare above, IV. i. 15, Ergo herus damuo
auctus est—Tu nescis id quod scis, “ You don’t (i. e. wont) know what
you do know ;” the present for the future. This is a case of oxy-
moron. Cf. II. iii. 82, Haud stulte sapis. In the Eunuchus, IV. iv.
54, we find, ‘⁸ Quod scis, nescis,” similarly used—Mutum dicon (me
esse, sc.)

ACT US IV.—Sc. V.

Cunnum pities Menedemus as regards the accession to his house·-
hold of Bacchis and her train. But he thinks it will be only after
some experience that his friend will feel it. Syrus addresses Chremes,
and proceeds to tell him the truth that Clinia is making his father
think Bacchis is Clitipho's mistress, whom he has taken home to hide .
the fact from Chremes. Clinia, too, says Syrus, pretends to his father
