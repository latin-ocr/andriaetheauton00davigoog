PROLOGUS.

ΤΗΒ prologue deals chiefly with answers to the attacks of Luscius
Lavinius, as in the prologue to the Andria. After showing why an
old actor, and not a young one, speaks the prolog ue, viz„ that he may
the better act as the poet' s advocate, and giving a slight sketch of the
play, he deals with the charge of blending many Greek plays into a few
Latin· and then that he is help ed by friends' 1n his composition (see
Adelph. Prol.,) touching which charges he throws himself on his
ωιᾶίἒιιοος and, before closing what he has to say, indulges in a hit at
the noisy characters (31) which are remarked in the plays of Lavinius.
He has himself, he says, in the Eunuchus, shown them bustle and life,
now he will give them a quiet play. Another ground on which he

appeds to the favour of his audience is, the liberality with which he
has heretofore acted towards them.

Metre. · lambio Trimeter.

1. Quoi, Quor: cui, cur. —Ne oui rit, Suc. L. Ambivius Turpio, the
head actor, spoke this prologus in person, contrary, as Bentley sup·
posce, to the usual custom of placing the prologus in the hands of “
a second or third· ·part actor. Bentley refers to Adelph. Prol. 22, and
Plaut. Trinumm. ProL 16. Ambivius would come on as Chremes,
immediately after speaking the prologue.

3. Quod veni, h. e. id propter quod veni. Namely, to explain the
author's obJects, and to be his advocate more efficiently than a young
actor could (lo—47). Quod veni has been improperly taken for the
acting which follows the prologue.—Inteyra--imeqram, “ a fresh
comedy from an untouched Greek comedy,” a play of Menander till
then untranslated by Latin poet—Heautontimorumenon. Horace
alludes to this play in Sat. Ι. ἰί. 18-22, and Cicero, Tusc. Disp. iii.

6. Bentley read “ simplex—duplici ; ’⁹ explaining that it was one
play with two plots (argumentum duplex), and Dacier and Ruhnken
hold this view. Preferable‚ we think, is the explanation of the text as
it stands, which Part-y gives from Eugraphius, “ Two plays from a
single argument,” h. e. a Greek play and a Latin play on the same

plot.l 'rho Latin poet did not look upon himself as a translator
mere y.
