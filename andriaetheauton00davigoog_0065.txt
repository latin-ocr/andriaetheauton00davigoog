PUBLII TERENTII AFRI ANDRIA.

PROLOGUS.

Metre : Iambic Trimeter.

1. Animum . . . appulit, “gave his mind to writingss’ The like phrase
is used below (II. vi. 15), “ animum ad uxorem appulit.” The use of
appellere with navem, which we note in Virg. AEn. iii.‚ 715, &c., is
secondary, and not, as Donatus would conclude, primary. See Smith’s
Dictionary and Parry on this passag'e. '

3. Populo . . . fabulas. “That the plays which he had made (or
wrought) should please the people.'' Observe here the atti-action of the
antecedent to the case of the relative. A case of it occurs at v. 26.
See also Virg. AEn. i. 574, “ urbem quam statuo vestra est.'’ Caesar i. 12,
“ Quae pars civitatis Helvetiae calamitatem . . . intulerat, ea princeps,'’
διο. Compare Wordsworth's Latin Gram„ p. 132, sec. 137, and Madvig.‚
sec. 319, obs—Fecisset. This verb is properly used, as Donatus observes
, of the play-wriyht’s art, Poeta being derived from ποιεῖν, and Drama
from δράω. Spenser uses the verb to make in this sense.

5—7. Construe “ For he wastes his xime in composing prologues,
while be narrates not the plot, but replies to the slanders of a spiteful
poet who is out of date.'’ This was Lavinius, of whom see observations
in the preface. For this use of “ abutor '' with accusative instead of
ablative‚ see Plaut. Bacchid. 11. iii.‚ 126, Trin. III. ii. 56, and compare
the same use of “ utor ¹⁹ in Plaut. Poenul. V. ii. 128, “Profecto uteris,
ut voles, operam meam.”—-The force of “qui ’⁹ in v. 6 seems to be
fflssssmGJ’ss..⁶¹23²53⁸-⁸³÷²}r ‘ssssnrefirmssfi’fassh‘’ {323325553 1⁰52&ss ’ὴ ῗιῗὲ
same whom, in the Prol. to Eunuch. 15, Terenceeupposes to say “ De·
functus nunc sum? Vetus is used in a bad sense as ‘⁴ veternosus.”

8. Quam rem . . . animum advortite, “ Now, pray you, note with what
they find fault? Animum advorto is here taken as if it were the verb
which is compounded of animum and adverto, which governs naturally
an accusative. Curious instances of a similar case, where a substantive
is gevemed not by the verb we should expect, but by the words which
are its equivalent, occur in Cicero's Divinatio. XIII. “ Quum illius
temporis mihi venit in mentem‚” which is i. q. “ quum illud tempus
animadverto.” Verres, Act ii. lib. i. 18.

9, Μοπαπάεν· . . . Andriam et Perinthiam. From Terence having
compounded his Andria of these two plays, he is called by C. Caesar
‘ Dimidiatus Menander ” (respecting the meaning of which word
Dimidiatus, and its difference from Dimidius, see Hildyard s Plaut.
