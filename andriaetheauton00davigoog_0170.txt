non factost usus, fit, quam quod factost opus, and Ter. Hecyr. 111. i.
47.-οΡω factost : see Andr. 111. ii. 10, 43, διο.

30. Si qwid laboris,'&c., “ If it involved any pain, I would be loth to
inquire, but what is this trouble of yours? ” Ruhnken appears to us
rightly to explain laboris, as in Andr. IV. iii. 5, V. i. 12, and V. ii 29.
Parry explains, “ If it were merely a question of work, ὥσθ’ In the
next verse, nurui-sti, says Govpanus, is i. q. admisisti. “

34. Jwvero. See Andr. IV. i. 16, 17.-Ηαο quidem camd, qud, αα,
“ Yes, even for this reason, which I've told you.'’ The relative is here,
by a Greek usage, attracted into the case of the antecedent. Compare
Madvig. Gr„ sect. 323, obe. 2. Hor. Sat. I. vi. 15, «Iudice, quo nostI,

o ulo. ·

Ρ ἕδ. Rastros, from rastrum “ a thing for seraping,’' th. rado. See
Donaldson, Varron. pp. 412, 413, on the meaning of words in ·trum.
Here it means hoes, or mattocks. See below, V. i. 58. On the change
of gender in the plural, cf. Madvig. 5⁹7. For adpone, some commen·
tators read·“ depone 3 ’³ but there is no need, since, as Ruhnken notes,
“ adpone” is used for “ depone,’' or “ ad pedes pone,’' in Plaut. Poen.
IV. ii. 35, At onus urget. Μι. At tu appone—Quam rem wis? ‘⁸ What
mean you ’ἐ ” Compare below IV. iv. 18.

38. Sine me vacivom, δια, “ Suffer me to grant myself no respite-time
from labour.”

40. Hui, tam mavia, hos, quaeso? “ Ah! [you will not persist in
carrying] these hoes, so heavy as they are, will you ’ἒ ” Chremes is

rastri.’' At this point Menedemus begins to tell the reasons of his
wlf-punishment.

46. Prope jam ut, ὅσα, “So much so as almost to regar-d her as his
wife even before 1 knew it ,- ’' jam implies this. With perdite in verse
45, we must supply “ita ” in sense, which ut follows.

49. Via pervolgata patrum, “ After the usual method of fathers.”
*Compare Hor. Sat. Ι. iv. 55, Quivis stomachetur eadem Quo personatus
pacto pater? Gronovius quotes the use of “ via,” as here, in Cicero,
Brutus, c. 46. In Verr. Act. i. c. 16. v. 68. Pro Caelio, c. 20. De
Finibus, i. 9. In almost all which passages “ via'’ is coupled with
“ ratione.” Via is a monosyllable here—Cotidie is i. q. Quotidie.—
Βίωνες, ιιι verse 51, is the present for the future, Plaut. Menaech. 148.

54. Tantisper—dum, ‘⁴ So long—as.” The usual construction. See
below, verse 95. Parry quotes Adelph. Ι. i. 45, where the order is
inverted, Dum id rescitum iri credat, tantisper pavet.— Volo implies
command, or imperiousness, here, as in Andr. 111. iii. 18, and Plaut.
Aulul. I. ii. 13, Ignem extingui volo.

58. Istuc cetam. Compare Livy, x. 24, Se id aetatis, ἀο. Tacit.
Annal. v. 9, Soc. See Madvig. sect. 285 b.

59. Pauper-iem differs from ‘⁸ paupertatem,” in the latter being used
of the middle class, the former of beggars. Hor. Ep. 1. i. 46, has,
Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa, per ignes.

60. Belli ylariam armis repperi, “ I found military glory in arms.”
Parry prefers this reading to ‘⁶ gloriam armis belli.” Belli does not
