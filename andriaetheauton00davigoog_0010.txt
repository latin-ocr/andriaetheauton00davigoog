but he has done this with ability, care, and judginent‚
discarding what was worthless, and separating the fine
gold from the dross.

But the editor’s greatest debt is to the Rev. J ames
Hildyard, whose *editions of the “ Aulularia '' and
“Menaechmei” of Plautus, are, to his mind, the very best
threshold through which to pass to a thorough apprecia-
tion of Plautus and Terence, and whose lectures on the
“ Miles Gloriosus ’' of Plautus it was his privilege and
good-fortune to hear delivered. At almost every page of

what follmw, some reference to Mr. Hildyard's Plays
will be found3 and many Latin students will echo the

wish now expressed‚ that that distinguished scholar may ἵ

employ his leisure in other like boons to the Classical
reader.

Another volume of this‘ series will probably contain t

the remaining plays of Terence3 and the editor trusts
that the present volume may meet such approval as to
render its successor's appearance not unwelcome.

The text adopted is, in the main, that of Fleckeisen,
in Teubner's Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graec. et Roman.
