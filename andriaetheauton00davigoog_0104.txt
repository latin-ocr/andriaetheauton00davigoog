Μ Male ominata νει-δι” Colman translates, “ Chrysis is then—ha!
Mysis. Yes‚ she has left us, poor souls.'’

9. Quid vos! “And you? How go you on here? Pretty we113 ”
A stranger’s queries.

10. Sic is taken by Parry to express, “ 8ο·80,” “ tolerably,” as 111 Ter.
Phorm. Ι. 11. 95, Sic, tenuiter. In that case we should punctuate
between sic and ut. But. perhaps Sic ut quimus means only “ even as,''
or “just as ” we cam—Aiunt is i. q. ut aiunt, “ as the saying is.’' Com-
mentators quote from Menander, ζῶμεν γὰρ, οὐχ ὥς θέλομεν, ἀλλ’ ὥς
δυνάμεθα. Cf. Hor. Od. 1. xxiv. 19, 20, Levius fit patientis Quidquid
corrigere est nefas.

12. Haud auspicatos ‘inauspiciouslyss’ “Ounluckilyss' Auspicato in
its primax-y sense, is, af“ter taking the auspices. ’⁹ For adverbs of this
form see Madvig. Gr. 198, obs. 2, and footnote r. “Appuli’' is the
usual reading, which suits the word auspicato well. Bentley read,

”8ιιι111.” For tetulissem, in the next verse, see Menaechm. 289, Pedem

.nunqua1n intro tetulit; and ibid, 532,Τοι1111 pedem. 'retuli is

the old form for tuli, a kind of reduplication, traces of which are seen
in “pepuli,” ” ιοιοι1(11,” “tutudiss' &c.

16. Lites εεφνὶ, 11. e. litigare3 “to engage 111881111- at· law. ’¹ Compare
Adelph. II. ii 40, Potius quam lites sequar. Phorm. 11. iii. 61, Potius
quam lites secter. For the old reading‘ ‘hiel’ in v. 16, Bentley replaced
id, from four MSS—Grcmdimcula, in v. 19, ‘pretty well grown up.'
Parry compares the form‘ ‘majuscula,'⁹ in Eunuch. 111. iii. 21.

20. Me sycophamtam, δια, “ι118ι sharper as Ι am, I’ m hunting her
inheritance, being really a beggar. ¹⁹ For the origin of this form (th.
σῦκον 811(1 φαίνω), see Aristoph. passim, and for its applied sense of
sharper or cheat, see Menaechm. (Hildyard) 177, 199, 985 ; Curc. 465,
810. In Au1u1.603, Sycophantia occurs. —Twn ipsam, δια, “Besides
I’ ve no wish to rob her.'’ “”Lubet is here preferable to‘ ‘lieetl'
