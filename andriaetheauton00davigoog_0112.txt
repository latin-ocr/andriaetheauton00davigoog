3. Nactus. Nanoiscor, apiscor‚ potior, are used of bad luck as well
as good, as Ruhnken shows from Phorm. 111. iii. 10; Phorm. 111. i. 5,
διο. Gronovius quotes Corn. Nep. in Att. c. 21, Nactus est morbum
quem initio et ipse et medici contempserunt.

6. Pater amicus amamus nobis, “ Her father is our most near friend,”
Colman. In ver. 7, the oldest MSS. are in favour of jam uxorem.
Several editors read “ eam,''——Num ille somniat, διο. Of. virg. Ecl. viii.
108, Credimus,an qui amant ipsi sibi somnia fingunt?

9. Solus est quem diliqwnt Di, “ He is the special object of the love of
the gods.” Commentators quote Menander, ὅν οἱθεοὶ φιλοῦσιν ἀποθνήσκει
νέος. If we read “ est,” it can scarcely be, but that we must suppose
the child dead ; an unsatisfactory solution surely. Bentley read, “ es,'‘
i. e. “Don’t talk of the child, you are the gods' special favourite.” See
Phorm. V. vi. 14. If we read, “ Solus est, quem diligant Di,” the
meaning may be, “ Say no more 1 He 's quite worthy to be a special
pet of the Gods Ι” a sort of ancient form of ‘⁴ Lord love him 1⁹·

11. Me in tuis secundis (rebus) respice. “ Don’t forget me in your good ’
fortunes.” Gronovius compares Plaut. Bacch. IV. iii. 24, Tace modo,
Deus nos aliquis respiciet. Poen. 1. ii.197 ; Rudens. V. ii. 29 3 Martial. ,
X. x. 5, Qui me respiciat, dominum regemque vocabo.

13. Adeo lonyum est ‘nos illum expectare, δια, “ It ’s so long for us to
wait till he comes forth? Gronovius says that, “adeo longum est ’⁹ is
elegantly put for “ nimis multum temporis intercedet.”

15. Auferam. Ruhnken properly interprete this of Glycerium being
carried across: see V. iv. 49, Huc transferri jubes? There seems no
reason for referring it to the pretended abduction of brides, iu allusion}
to the rape of the Sabine women3 respecting which custom, see Catub
LXI. 3. and 166, 167.-—I¹ntus despondebitur, “ 'Phe espousals will be}
within.” Many MSS. have Ω. before Plaudite ,· perhaps a corruption of}
CA„ for Cantor, which Bentley reads, and we retain here. Hor. A. P.
154, Donec cantor “ vos plaudite ’⁹ dicat. Modern editors omit the*
“ Alter exitus Andriaess’ which is manifestly spurious.
