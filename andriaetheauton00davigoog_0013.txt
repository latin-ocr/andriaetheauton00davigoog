BIOGRAPHICAL No'rlcn 01³· TERENGE. · vii

Biography,'' vol. iii„ 997—1001 ; Parry’s Introduction to his
edition of Terence, in the “ Bibliotheca Classica ;'' Dunlop's
“ Roman Literature,’' i„ 279—3433 and Liddell's “History
of Rome,” vol. ii.‚ 162—164. ’

It seems inconsistent with the size and scope of the present
volume, to prefix to it any account of the Terentian Metres,
which would be, at best, only a reiteration of Professor Key,
or Mr. Pan-y. The simpler course will probably be to point
. out the sources whence all needful light may be obtained, and
to commend the reader to one or more of these for a full
insight into the subject. The following list enumerates

these sources :—

Professor Key's article “ On the Meti-es of Terence snd Plautus.”
(“ English Journal of Education,” vol. ii.‚ pp. 344, seq.)

Professor Key’s Latin Grammar.

Bitschl’s Prolegomena to Plautus, vol. i., ch. ι, διο.

Donaldson' s Varronianus, pp. 440—444.

Penny Cyclopaedia3 articlest ‘Terentian Meti-es.

Preface to ΜΓ. Parry’ s Terence (‘ ‘Bibliotheca Classica' ’,) pp. xxvii——

lxviii.
An Introduction to the Matres of the Andria, prefixed to an edition

of that play by Mr. N. Travers, B. A., Lincoln college, Oxou.
1858.

The last of these will ‚be found particularly concise and
useful.

Those who desire to go deeply and thoroughly into this
subject, will, of course, apply themselves, in the first instance,
to the researches of Bentley and Hermann on Terentian
Menes-
