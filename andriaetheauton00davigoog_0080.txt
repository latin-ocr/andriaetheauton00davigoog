“ But you are not a bit of use to me, save in those things which are

nowise needful to be known.” Opus here, as often, is used adjectivally‚

and “ nil '' is the accusative of limitation—quin' hinc, “Arn’t you

gfff? §CR 17, abin')—Eyo vero, ao lubens, “ To be sure Ι am, and with
my eart.'’

ACTUS IL—so. ΙΙ.

Davus in this scene details his reasons for supposing these nuptiale
to be pretended‚ and on this ground urges Pamphilus to feign consent

to them.

Metro .— Trochaic Tetrgmeter catalectic.

1. Di boni. cf. Eun. IL i. 19, Di boni, quid hoc morbi est? Ac-
, cording to Donatus and others, the word “porto '⁹ indicates the
magnitude of the news borne here. See the use of Porto, Hecyr. ΙΙΙ.
v. 63, and above, of apporto, Ne quid Andria apportet mali. Nescio
quid (sc. propter).

4. Toto me oppido exanimatum qwoerere, “is breathlessly secking me
up and down the town.” These words supply the close of the sentence ·
begun at Quem ego, v. 4.--Toto oppido, i.q. in toto oppido, as in Ov.
Ep. i. 21, Quisquis erat castris jugulatus Achivis (Ruhnken).

6. quo . . . intendam, “or whither now first bend my steps,'' “whither
wend firstss‘ This verb is used absolutely in Cic. Catil. i. 12, Quo
intendit, in castra Manliana pervenit. In v. 7, Donatus mentions the
reading “ habeo,'' as well as “ abeO.” In a very early edition before us,
both readings are spoken of as identicaL Parry illustrates the
use of thef‘ h,” by Holim, for “olim,” and ‘⁶ hostium'’ for “ostium'' iu
some MSS. Bentley prefers “habeo‚’' “I have it !” But the word
‘⁶ resisto ’' seems to indicate that “ abeo‚” ‘·I 'm offl’ was meant. Steph.
Doletus explains “resisto,'' as a metaphor from beasts of bur-den
suddenly checked through fear. It is very commonly used for “to ⁴
stop.'’ See Phorm. V. vi. 10, Id tibi fiet nisi resistis. Quis Romam.
Cf. ‘⁴ cui homini‚’' for “ cui,’' Hecyra ΙΙΙ. iv. 17.

8. Opportwne (adestis, scil.).—— Vos volo, cf. above, Ι. i. 2, Paucis te
volo. Servius on AEn. xii. 342, quotes this passage, Ambo opportune*
vos volo, and thence goes on to remark that the ancient accusative of
‘⁶ ambo ’⁹ was “ambo,'' and so does Pierius on Virg. Georg. iv 88,
Verum ubi ductores acie revocaveris ambo. But our later reading

seems more Terentian.
9. Perii . . . interii. A case of the figure auxesis, the latter verb

signifying more utter ruin than the former. Compare other verbs
compounded with inter, e. g. interbibere, intercipere, interminari.
One of the old commentatore quotes a verse from Plautus, ⁸‘ Qui per
virtutem perit, non interit.’‘—Qui¹n tu Ιιοσ audi, “ Nay, but, hear you

this '3 ’' Eun. V. ii. 63, Quin tu me servato.
10. Quidem hercle certe. Parry illustrates this collocation of three

affirmative particles by Phorm. Ι. iii. 12, and the Gr. μενοῦν γε. Of.
